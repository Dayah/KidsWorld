    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shroomy, one of the Anti-KidsWorld leaders, e-mailed me saying me she was not peer-pressured into joining, it was through her own free will. In response, I changed the wording of my comment on how themrbon peer-pressures people into joining to how he peer-pressures <I>many</I> into joining.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Themrbon and I exchanged a few e-mails concerning my posting of his personal e-mail address. He is threatening to contact the webmaster of benray.com and have him take the address down. I just happen to be the webmaster, and no, I will not take it down. I don't know why he does not want this posted. My assumption is that his parents have access to that address, and he does not want them to see what is going on.</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I've been seeing the word &#147;degrated&#148; in e-mails, feedback posts, and even the official Anti-KidsWorld site. I think the word you are looking for is <B>degraded</B>, from the root word degrade, meaning <I>to put down</I>.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shroomy has erected <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SouthBeach/Cove/7109/">her own Anti-KidsWorld page</A>. I encourage you to read all points of view before you make a decision. You should stop by this place as well.</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Themrbon accused me of &#147;hacking&#148; into Shroomy's page and adding obscene pictures. I do not &#147;hack&#148; web pages. These accusations have no evidence and are purely speculative. I ask themrbon to find some evidence instead of blindly accusing others of attacking Anti-KidsWorld member's pages. Also, I noticed themrbon is trying to make KidsWorld look bad yet <B>again</B>. After guessing that me or someone from KidsWorld hacked that page, he says, &#147;We are not doing ANYTHING to them..and you see how the[y] act?&#148; and requests feedback.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was just looking at the old Anti-KidsWorld page. I have noticed how they changed their mission from boycotting KidsWorld to reforming it. Their original page contained phrases such as, &#147;DONT GO THERE!&#148; and, &#147;Yes this is True! Kidsworld Is like Prision!&#148; It was nothing more than a blatant attack on KidsWorld. They also pointed out that, &#147;They also don't allow other types of Sexual Preference&#133;&#148; Since then, the issue seems to have changed, and Anti-KidsWorld has weakened. In addition, note that their new page was put up after this one.</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anti-KidsWorld has somehow found the link to the preliminary Official KidsWorld Rebuttal. I have no idea how this came about, since only the KidsWorld IRCops and I were told about it. I have also been informed that because of this leak of information, that page will be moved to a new address. On the topic of the Official KidsWorld Rebuttal, that page should be complete in approximately two to three days.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I made this page, I decided to protect the anonymity of the person who threatened to have any site that posted the <A HREF="usclub.html#survey">US Club Survey</A> &#147;hacked.&#148; Themrbon sent me an e-mail saying that these were &#147;false claims,&#148; and that I should remove it from the page. In response, I will expose the identity of this person and exactly what was said.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was one minor correction to the page in that e-mail. Themrbon was G-Lined from KidsWorld and was not officially fired. In addition, he is requesting that I remove the reference linking US Club to Anti-KidsWorld, which is utterly preposterous.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In one of my earlier news entries, I mentioned that Anti-KidsWorld has gone from boycotting to reforming KidsWorld. I understood what they wanted to do in the beginning. Now, their motive is unclear. They vaguely mention that KidsWorld's &#147;'insides' need reconstruction.&#148; What do they want KidsWorld to change? It seems to me that a supposedly organized group should have its goals straight. Anti-KidsWorld needs to get their act together, <B>then</B> recruit members. For what reason are the Anti-KidsWorld members fighting?</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was searching for &#147;themrbon&#148; on the Internet earlier today and found one of <A HREF="themrbon.html">his old pages</A>. I just thought that was something interesting to contribute on such a mundane day.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would like to direct your attention toward the bottom of Anti-KidsWorld's <A HREF="www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/Heights/7402/emails.html">E-mails of harassment</A> page. I noticed an e-mail supposedly from Lema (KidsWorld founder) to Anti-KidsWorld, but on closer inspection, I found that it is nothing but a fraud. Below is the header of the e-mail. From the header, you can tell where the e-mail originated.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are a few extremely strange things about this header. First, the message appears to have been sent to a HotMail account but was certainly not received from a HotMail account. We know this because the second line clearly tells us that someone with the login LKELLEY, sent the message through their mail server, exchange.nhboston.com. Note that themrbon's last name is Kelley. Second, the mail header is incomplete. Fields such as the e-mail client and originating IP are suspiciously missing. It is my conclusion from this evidence that themrbon has mailed this to himself and simply changed parts of the header to make it look as if it was sent by Lema.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A friend who frequents KidsWorld has expressed deep concern for his girlfriend who is part of Anti-KidsWorld. Hearing all this about themrbon all but makes him more concerned. He was asking for advice on how to get her out of the Anti-KidsWorld cult, which I cannot provide. I call Anti-KidsWorld a cult because it has all the classic characteristics of a cult. There is a leader that all the members follow unconditionally, themrbon. The group has yet to establish a goal. The members have lost all their individuality for the &#147;good of the group.&#148; Everything is done to help the self-proclaimed leader. Most of the members are outcasts, followers looking for a place in which they fit.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seems that themrbon has stepped back from claiming that e-mail of harassment was sent by Lema. He now supports the fact that it &#147;was someone faking lema.&#148;</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I heard through the grapevine that Shroomy, a leader of Anti-KidsWorld, might want to leave the group and come back to KidsWorld, where she is <B>not</B> welcome. Rumor is she is losing friends and sees that nothing will be accomplished. Her boyfriend has told me that he will resort to threatening their relationship if it comes to that. Please don't e-mail me with &#147;corrections,&#148; as it is just a rumor I heard. If I hear any more about this, I will write about it in subsequent news postings.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anti-KidsWorld has posted their main goals on their <A HREF="www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/Heights/7402/info.html">About AKWClub</A> page. They are vague for goals of a supposedly well-organized group. What exactly do they expect from KidsWorld? A formal letter saying that they have cleaned up their act? KidsWorld barely even acknowledges this group. I guess we will see what happens in the coming weeks.</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rumor that Shroomy wants out of Anti-KidsWorld has been confirmed as false. Although, Shroomy expresses that she does not want to be thought of as having the same sexuality as most of the other members. She feels that a bad association has been made between her and the now non-existent US Club, the previous incarnation of Anti-KidsWorld.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In my Thursday, November 27 post, I spoke of a relationship in jeopardy due to one of the friend's involvement in Anti-KidsWorld. The active Anti-KidsWorld member severed her contact with Tha_Joker, who has given permission for his name to be used here. Unfortunately, it came down to him threatening their relationship. With a few final words from the Anti-KidsWorld member, it was officially over. Personally, it deeply saddens me that Anti-KidsWorld has separated two people who sincerely liked each other.</FONT></TD></TR>
