<ALIGN="MIDDLE"> Hello, thanks for stopping by. Please remember this page
is under construction, and will change weekly.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>*^*^*^*^*<u>PLEASE, REMEMBER THESE ARE ONLY MY THOUGHTS
AND VIEWS...NO ONE ELSE'S. IF YOU THINK YOU WILL FIND ANYTHING ON MY PAGE
THAT IS DEGRADING KIDSWORLD, AND YOU MAY FIND IT OFFENSIVE...LEAVE NOW :o)</u>*^*^*^*^</p>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>
There has been a lot of controversy about the KW/AKW situation. I, personally, side with AKW. That is why I decided to become an AKW leader. There are a lot of issues with <a href="http://www.kidsworld.org">KidsWorld</a>, that should require the direct attention of the IRCops. I was a helper with KidsWorld, and I saw these things. I will explain them in as much detail as I can on this site. Or, you can go directly to the AKW <a href="http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/Heights/7402">site</a><p>
First off, I would like to say, that I chatted at KidsWorld for a lengthy period of time. I saw nothing wrong with it, or the people there. I figured, "Hey, a place where kids can come to chat without worrying about being harassed or messed with". That is probably what the rest of you think, huh? <p>
Well, that began to change after a while. I noticed that the helpers seemed to do all of Lema's work for her. Then, I brought it to the attention to some of my friends, who were also helpers. 
They stated that they had been sworn at, my opinions on the fact that :<p>
<u>The IRCops swear at children</u>- This is a rather touchy issue. In most homes, the children aren't sworn at by their parents. So, what gives the right of a perfect stranger possibly 2000-4000 miles away to? How can a server state it is safe from adult predators who harass and swear at children, when the IRCops themselves are guilty of the same thing? You IRCops can answer that, can't you?<p>
I also heard rumors from people that a certain IRCop was bi-sexual. I really don't care about sexuality. God made us all different for his own purposes. I don't impose on that. I really didn't pay it much mind until I was told by themrbon that he was being sexually harassed by this IRCop after he openly announced his sexuality. What is that? <p>
I don't completely understand that issue. I also don't understand why an adult can degrade a child over their sexuality. I, personally, am straight, but that doesn't necessaraly mean everyone else is. I can guarantee you, If Lema, maker of KidsWorld was bi-sexual or gay, KidsWorld would be suited to fit her needs. That is one of my main points. In my opinion, KidsWorld is suited to fit Lema's needs and wants, and not the needs and wants of the children who chat there! In this issue, Lema hasn't given much input, but the helpers and people who chat there have. Why is that? Can she not stand up for herself instead of letting other people do it for her? Does she actually see the wrong of her actions and she doesn't want to live up to it?<p>
Yes, I am 13, maybe I am not exactly as experienced with law and life as the adults are, but I am FAR from naive, and I DO know right from wrong. Swearing and sexually harassing children is WRONG! I think they should live up to their own actions, instead of falling back on themrbon's mistakes. Lema called themrbon conniving, and basically degraded him. Lema, is that the way you talk to all children? Or, is it only the way you talk to kids who disagree with you, and your standards? You all have lied to cover yourselves. Then, you turn around and say WE are lying. LuceNT, an ex-helper/IRCop of KidsWorld made his own <a href="http://www.benray.com/kidsworld">site</a> in defense of KidsWorld. I seriously suggest you see it.<p>
I would like for everyone to know that AKW is not a "bisexual club" or a "cult". We do not brainwash people into joining. If someone joins AKW, it is by their own choice. Now, I was informed today by a "source" that Lema has been sending spies over to AKW to have them join. To you : Lema, I figure you to be acting ill-mannered and terribly childish. Honestly, sending a spy? This is not ID4, or some other presidental spy movie. This is a real situation with real issues that need to be adressed. C'mon. Act grown!<p>
Thank you for stopping by and seeing my side of the story....
Please come back, as I will be posting more about this issue.<p>
