First off, i want to tell Lema and her little stooges that degrading and TRYING to insult my mom was ill-mannered and Very immature. As Cass stated, themrbon would regret messing with You, Lema...It would be very wise for you not to insult my mom. I wanted her to see the story, now she sees that fact that you all are acting like 3 year olds! Get over it KW. Face the fact that you are wrong! The only thing you all are falling back on are themrbon's mistakes! What about your own? Learn to be a man/woman! Stop playing childish school yard GAMES!

Heya Everyone,

Well we have launched our new PAKW! Lead by AKWMom!

Let me state this, LuceNT's page does give false information or he doesnt 'seek it out' ..he add's it to the page, does this give you the concept that he is always right? I dont think so.  We are always and have NEVER (AND I DO MEAN NEVER) have posted a L
E up here.  Though he takes rumors and add's it to his page.

We are also launching our AKWNews this week! Want to get on the mailing list?

e-mail us at AKWnews@hotmail.com

thank you!

Orkie Dorkie! Thanks mom. I am glad we have an adult's perspective on all of this. To KW: I don't like the fact that you don't allow vulgar language on your server, yet you say things to the helpers that would make my mom's bf (A SAILOR) blush! Also, I do
't understand why you all fall back on themrbon's mistakes, but won't live up to your own? C'mon people. Learn to accept responsibility for your actions, 14 year old themrbon did!

For starters, I am Shroomy's (Jillian's) mother.  I have visited KidsWorld, and their rebuttal page. Personally, I think this is totally wrong for the adults (?) to continue bashing these kids for their opinions.  I watched as my daughter was harassed for
her opinions, and her friendships on KidsWorld.  How is it proper for adults to ask children not to do something they themselves are guilty of doing?  As for the other adults that have posted here, I respect your right to have your opinions, but if you ar
 only coming here to harass these kids, why bother?  If you want your children to utilize KidsWorld, go right ahead, no one is stopping you.  Just remember, these kids have first-hand experience with that private network, and know what they are talking ab
ut.  
Paul, as for Jillian not having her own opinions, I know for a fact that she is VERY opinionated in her own right.  No one, not even me, can put a thought in her head that she does not want there, or has not completely analyzed first!
Thank you for giving me the chance to speak my mind.  I will be back to check up on progress now and then.

You stated you have visited KW. Right? Well...you know their part then. You haven't tried to listen to us. Take the time and try, I know you will be glad you did. -peace- and Happy Turkey Day a day late

*Yawn* Happy Turkey Day!

ok :-) First off, To car54, those e-mails ARE not fake..i can send them to you... ONE was from Lema (her daughter) and the other was someone faking lema. 

I DO NOT LIE AND I NEVER WILL LIE !

Now...  

Deb, your thoughts are ok :-) But our ONLY goal is for Kidsworld TO notice we dont like the way they treat people.

Ok :-) I'm not arguing you all have fun

Okie Dokie...Deb...you told us of our typos...well....here's one for you...Its KidsWorld..not KidsWorl :o)
Car54...you are on of the IRCops who harassed themrbon in the first place. Also, AKW is STILL up and will remain up. Because, even if we are not there, other kids are. We are trying to look out for their safety. Something most of you neglect to do!

Ok, Ty...I went to your page....I saw the log.  Still, it doesn't show to me tht you were treated as 'slaves' just that you were expected to WORK once you were asked to be a helper and accepted (or once you asked to be one and were accepted)  Ok, his lang
age towards you was rough, I admit that.  As for my life...it's just fine...I was merely trying to point out that you won't be taken seriously until you DO learn how to spell.  You also ask if I think the kids would speak up?  Darn right I do...for 2 reas
ns.  1)  If they didn't LIKE Kidsworld, they wouldn't be there, they could leave.  2)  If they thought they were being treated badly, they wouldn't remain helpers. Do you seriously think I am going to waste my time debating the merits/demerits of Kidsworl
?  If you don't like it, stay off.  If you want it to change, tell them what to change (from what I have seen here, no one has...correct me if I'm wrong)  It's 'movements' like yours that end up being the ruin of a great thing.  I for one will continue to
allow my child to go to Kidsworld, and do..in fact..encourage her to find out how to become a helper there.

you guys want KW to change, but your leader was banned for distributing sexually explicite material, and al your members have been banned. you arent even supposed to or allowed to return to kidsworld. so WHY DO YOU STILL WANT IT TO CHANGE????? you have no
hiong to do with it (or at least you shouldnt) so i believe you should give it up. your page was OK and i didnt have a problem with it until you posted more and more lies, your page is nothing but lies, when i look through it, those e mails you faked from
lema@kidsworld.org are TOTALLY fake, the headers are wrong, and theres  certian markings on mails from lema that determine they are hers. your mails from her bear none of those markings, which proves they are fake. i could go into more sdeatail, but i don
 think it is nessacery.

Okay, I was gone for a few days...and this...

...Yep, like after all of this comes up, people are going to say they were treated as slaves. Yet, all of us at AKW were helpers and were treated as slaves. Smooth move. Really. I have a life too...but that doe'snt mean I cant take time away from my life 
o talk to someone. Obviously it can't be all that great if you are going to come here to correct our spelling. We are kids. Typos and misspelled words happen. Some adults who have left feedback here have made  errors in their typing also. Techyman: Hush..
lease, just hush, what you are saying is immature and ill-mannered. Geez

I don't need to set up a 'date' with you.  Unlike you, I have a life.  Furthermore, why not just POST your alleged proof, and get on with it.  You talk about what Kidsworld falls back on MANY times...but all I see from you is what you CLAIM to have.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm just about tired of this "we have proof." I've never seen any proof of anything you say. Finally you admit you need to get your act together. What is this? You should reform KidsWorld, but we don't know how, we'll figure 
t out soon! I talk about this kind of stuff day by day on my <A HREF="http://www.benray.com/kidsworld/news.html">news page</A>.

I have been watching all that is going on here with interest...and I see a few things here that need to be mentioned.  1) It's DEGRADING, not degrating.  Before anyone will ever take you seriously, you need to learn how to spell.  2) I see no proof of any
hing, anywhere.  I went to Kidsworld myself to tour and talked to a few of the workers there, as well as, a few of the kids.  None of them mentioned, in any way, that they thought they were being 'used' or 'enslaved' at all, and yes, I did ask.  I am not 
ne who will form an opinion about something without getting the facts from both parties.  I have the facts from one side, Kidsworld..who was kind enough to meet with me and discuss all that went on.  I have yet to see anything HERE that is remotely factua
, only opinions, 1/2 truths, and easily disproved lies.  In the words of Tom Cruise in Jerry McGuire.. "Show me the money!!"

all, once you finally prove that you are good enuf they make you a Junior and thats final, they leave you alone. BUT for all you FRESHMAN or SOPHOMORE helpers: B-Ware, and try your best to help, or get ages.  I don't have time to fight.  SiNcErLy, Ty "DaT

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, themrbon, your argument has turned from pure opinion, to half truths, to pure lies! Let me say this yet again, I don't work for KidsWorld After I have said this umpteen times you still say, "and LuceNT still works out th
re."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, You don't seem to understand the difference between fact and opinion. "Their IRCops (workers) dont listen to kids." That is an called opinion, not fact.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, Anti-KidsWorld has <B>4</B>, yes only four members. I have just talked to one of the four, and he only knows the 3 that all the other members know about. Either these other <I>secret</I> members are so secret no o
e but themrbon knows about them, or they are fictional. I would tend to believe the latter.

OK, first tp paul, if logs dont hold up, why does kidsworld just use the stupid USclub information, that's their only backup,  I hate to tell you paul, kidsworld might be PRIVATE but, it's a wrongful server... and NONE of these logs , e-mails, have ever b
en altered.  True, they said they wont particapate.. but now they are 'allowing' people too, EX. LuceNT, car54, techyman, and are saying that they are not apart of kidswrold.. As to.. Techyman is a IRCop there, Car54 is, and LuceNT still works out there. 
 We are not the ones sending e-mails to them, saying you little **** we are hacking into this site. When i get home today, this page will show only facts. and that's what i am doing. you can believe what you do, but we do have other people who KNOW truth 
eartful i tell the truth.


To Techyman,

your attitude as changed since we've talked last.  I hate to burst your bubble,  we do have member.. round 10 of them,   and more coming.  Now,  are you apart of kidsworld? or doing this on your own? 

and you must think of something.. Your involved in this to Techyman... they are just covering up for you,  since  you stayed on their side.  you do know what i mean

thanks

You say that you arent lying. How do I know this is true? As I have stated already, posting of logs, emails or other recorded information can be altered and does NOT hold water anywhere. What I think Phoenix is saying, is that Kidsworld will no longer par
icipate with comments to this page. However, they do have the right to defend themselves. Which is exactly what they are doing by posting a rebutall page. I again state, Kidsworld is a PRIVATE network and the administrators there are able to make the rule
. The thereoy of 'constitutional rights' is nulled when on the internet. People CHOOSE to be on the internet. As well as people CHOOSE to not be on the internet. The policy CHOOSEN to regulate Kidsworld, is a fair one as far as I can see. Its my belief yo
 only started this group to get back at the folks of Kidsworld for being fired. There have been a few postings here from current Kidsworld helpers. They don't have any problems or feel like they are being slaved. Im sure your group is only but a few. And 
hose few are past friends that have decided to help to being given status at Talkcity. Shroomy, you say that you are not a dog and don't follow people around, you do your own thing. Why is it that you only comment on what Themrbon has already said? You do
't seem to be able to form your own opinion without help from him. This statment from me is a rather harsh one, but I feel you are only out demoralize Kidsworld.
Your actions in starting this page only attracts more attention to Kidsworld. The adults that view this will be curious as to what it is all about. They will tour Kidsworld and, in my belief, see that what you are saying is nothing but a figment of your o
n imagination. You made your own problems at Kidsworld. Kidsworld did not make them for you.

Paul, 

We dont lie, we are acting in a professional manner.. We did have people e-mailing us that they  are going to hack into our website, i will post them later on, it's been busy, We let the dude back in, due to we give second chances. Now, you see one side, 
nd agree. But, I hate to tell you, We are not playing on a childish level, as the others are.. like i said, your views are appreicated. But, we do know what we are doing. 

thank you

Paul,
I understand what you mean, except,
like I have stated before, you had to have been there. I make no false accusations. I am NOT a liar. I saw what goes on there. The ONLY reason we let that imparticular person back into AKW is the fact that we are people of a second chance. Have you seen t
e KW rebuttle page? Maybe you should. On that page, they edited the survey so the people's names who still chat on KW aren't there. If the people on that survey were open enough to answer it, then why would it need to be edited? No reason. They obviously 
idnt mind people seeing it.

Yep, me again. I will keep it brief this time, as I have already given most of my opinion on this matter. Between Themrbon and Shroomy, I continulessly see accusations made by them against Kidsworld. No where do I see any proof, nor do I see any Kidsworld
member here attacking your group. I think you kids have alot of growing up to do and should study letigation when you get older, as it seems you like to accuse and cloud the issues of things. Not to mention you need to delegate yourselves in a more profes
ional manner.
You say that Kidsworld sent a spy into your group, ONLY to let him back in with open arms. You say that Kidsworld is hacking your webpage, but no where do I see any changes to it. You only seem to be commenting on each other's posting. You never really an
wered my questions from my prior postings. This shows lack of maturity and thought put into your statments. You seriously have some priority issues that need to be address.

There are three points I would like to make today. One, I have caught wind of a rumor that someone who hates "gay bashers" would like to "fight" me for harassing Anti-KidsWorld members. I have nothing against gays or bi-sexuals. I have someone who in my i
meadiate family who is bi-sexual, but a kids' network is NO PLACE to promote your sexual orientation.<BR>
Two, I do not harass the Anti-KidsWorld members, I have only replied to themrbon's e-mails, and have never cursed at him. In fact, Shroomy and I have a friendly thread of e-mail going back and forth.<BR>
Three, I am NOT ASSOCIATED WITH KIDSWORLD. Here, let me say that again. I AM NOT ASSOCIATED WITH KIDSWORLD. If you read my page, you will notice I was fired from KidsWorld quite a while from there. I do chat there because I feel it is a good place for kid
. Lema does not tell me what to put there, nor does anyone from KidsWorld. It is entirely fact and my personal account of what happened. KidsWorld's offical rebuttal is due out Monday. If you want an offical statement from KidsWorld, stop by their site on
Monday.<BR>
Oh, one more thing about harassment. When I posted themrbon's personal e-mail address on my page, he messaged 5 (FIVE) people from KidsWorld and told them to tell me to take it down. After that he e-mailed me and threatened me to take it down or he would 
ontact the webmaster of benray.com. It's a shame that I am the webmaster, now isn't it?

Ladies and Gentlemen..let me re-state what my point was earlier.... now, Lema's slaves, get this little note to lema for me, will ya? :-) Or better yet, tell her to come over here herself. Ok, #1- Since she enjoys her 'rebuttal' she can get geocities in t
is...and hell, contact my isp and ask them to join too!!! I'm sure they would love to have 1 less customer. Contact them...or just tell me and I'll do it myself..little threats don't work with me. car54, lucent, and phoenix, get lives, will ya? I mean, ph
enix, you're lame, I swear! Come to TalkCity try to mess with a staff member while he's trying to work and say, "I want to join US." Sorry to burst your bubble but that was stopped about 1-3 months ago for reasons I care not to discuss. Now, are we all on
the same level to conprehend this? I'm pretty sure my little cousin (7) could understand this. Cheers!

Okay, Like themrbon said..."WAY TOO FAR." KidsWorld: Understand! Please, try. We are NOT trying to take you all down! We are trying to show you all there are problems with KW that could be dangerous. Why are you acting like children about this? Sending a 
py? Honestly people! C'mon. I think Lema,Car54,(whoever else), themrbon, and myself need to chill and talk. This has gone far enough. Sheesh...e-mail me.

OK THIS HAS GONE TO FAR!!!

#1-Kidsworld sends Vertman to our 'club' and i knew he was up to something, so i let him join..and one of my friends from Kidsworld tells me that he was over there talking bout our club.. so i sent him a termination letter, and Car54 says 'nice newsletter
 i send Member NEWSLETTERs :).. WTG Kidsworld...let's act like kids why dont we!

#2-Someone hacked into Shroomy's page and puts obscene pictures on her site.. WTG that's just great.. We do suspect car54, or LuceNT..due to this two are causing the 'most' trouble to us.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

We are not doing ANYTHING to them..and you see how  the act? GIVE US YOUR VIEWS

Okay, I do suppose I really must state my reasons for joining AKW. I believe some people on KW are hypocrites. I also believe "slaving" children is WRONG. Online or not. Personally, I have a lot of opinions on this issue. I will add more to my website (cl
ck above on where it says Visit me)
About the VertMan thing : I seriously think it was  seriously wrong of KidsWorld to send a "spy". To you ALL :We haven't degrated you, bashed you, Hacked you,or tried to invade you all. I really wish, as the adults you are, that you have the same respect 
or us as we have had for you!! This will be my last time asking, because it is seriously annoying me. Next time...Act your age!

Paul,

As themrbon said, I am my own person. I don't respond to peer pressure. I am not a little dog who follows people around. I hope you will understand that. I came here becuase I believe some things on KW need to be changed. In my own opinion (and i was a he
per...I saw it all) KW is made to fit Lema's needs. I would like to know...have you heard their side? I have to go now. Please visit MY AKW site at
www.geocities.com/SouthBeach/Cove/7109
For all of my opinions and views and a few facts too. Thanks for your feedback!! Hope to see more of it!

Dear Paul..

Answering your Questions.. #1- Kidsworld IS ok for kids but they need to change things.. like Their IRCOPS going after kids..which they have banned two for that.

#2-I 'left' Kidsworld..and THEN they banned me..not like they are saying.. I left kidsworld WAY before this happened.

#3-This 'us'club was quit yes, do to it was publicized by a Kidsworld worker wanting in and when he did he went off to tell his boss to get a good praise..

#4-Talkcity - Isnt my Server nor does Shroomy have a status on there... I do cause i've worked there for so long... a AKW leader is an independant position. She has no status there..

#5- as to your 'light'.... I'm not  a  pusher NO ONE IN THIS ANTI KW CLUB WAS FORCED in..they joined on their owns.. As well, that USclub that is NOT UP NO MORE.. was the same, i didnt  push NO ONE.

I have no confusion except why kidsworld doesnt udnerstand WHAT ARE POINT Is :)...

As to the 'mistake'

I have admitted it..but this club Isnt towards THAT problem..it's to many others.

Kidsworld abused my 'privacy' right and the people who were in that 'club' authorized me on their ICQ knowing full well who i was.

I will like to say again, Kidsworld is bringing out that one problem with the USclub..which this page has NOTHING to do with.  Anything relavant to that ISNT our mission.

and If i did Tell Lema the founder, i would have been glined anyway, i was told this.

See, our Mission it to let people know there's a few things they need to fix..and I WILL STATE again..  once they are, this goes down.

Thank you for replying Paul, We do appreciate your opinions :)

Me again...In your replys to my posting:
Youre right. I wasn't there to see it. But I still reafrim the idea that IRCops are given the status for a reason. Reasons would include (but not limited too), trustworthiness, hard worker, dedication. Those qualities in a person seem hardly the ones of a
person that would harrass an individual for speaking their mind. IIt is my belief, that you were banned from the network for going about the way you did. I see that you keep stating that you did not go through Kidsworld to give out the survery, but you we
t through ICQ. I ask this, how did you obtain the names of the persons you sent that survey to? Most likely from making friends and aquantinces from Kidsworld. You seem to be upset over the fact that you were caught doing something against Kidsworlds' pol
cy and can not live up to your mistakes. You keep stating that Kidsworld is a good place and you would still tell kids to go there, yet you say they need to fix some things? What are these 'things'? And why would you praise a network, only to slap them in
the face later? You say that your parents would not like the fact of what you're doing? So why do it? You are plenty able speaking your opinion elsewhere. Instead, you seek out to the kids of Kidsworld and try to make them see 'your light'. When in fact, 
your light' is cluttered with confusion and hatred and you continue to mention Talkcity. Jillian stated that she is a 'leader' there. Is this not 'status' on ones network, regardless if it is yours or not? Why was the club closed? Because you realized tha
 you made a mistake and instead of admitting it, you start an 'anti-kw' club? You say Kidsworld abused your right. Abused your right to what? To send out a survey to Kidsworld users, boys seemingly, and ask them what their penis size is??? As a parent and
avid user of IRC, I certainly would have banned you too if I found out this was circulating a network that I was a part of. I'm sure that if you didn't try to be so sneaky about it, none of this would have happened.

Thank you Paul for your enlightened perspective. We don't get many of those on this web board, just ramblings and flames. I'm not an offical from KidsWorld, nor am I biased towards or against KidsWorld, but I have been there for quite a while, at minimum 
 months longer than themrbon, and much longer than any of his Anti-KidsWorld followers. Themrbon was okay in the beginning, he is just angry over being fired, but he has taken this too far, which makes me angry. I don't know why he and his group bring up 
tuff about KidsWorld policies and rules, that has nothing to do with the issue here. In fact, there is no issue, just an angry kid who wants revenge on a good IRC network. If you want to hear the other side of the story, visit...
http://www.benray.com/kidsworld
This page is not supported or frowned upon by KidsWorld. It is my personal accumulation of facts and some opinions. Also you will find "the list" on this page. I think after viewing "the list" (the survey they were speaking of, and that is verified in the
rbon's logs, this page's address plus logs.html) you will that this group isn't much. The only thing I've heard about them is this survey. No web site, no newsletter. Also, I'm all for this freedom of sexual preference, but peer-pressuring others into lik
ng what you like? That has taken it too far. You can read my full opinion and "the list" on my page. Note that I don't want you to join a Pro-KidsWorld club, I just want to show you both sides of the argument. I look forward to seeing the Anti-KidsWorld m
vement's new page.

--- LuceNT out.

Dear Paul,
thanks for the comments..let me explain... that club has been shut down.. our 'views' of it then were wrong. and we know that, as i have stated earlier..but our point here is the way we were treated... I was harassed..as i have stated.. I'm NOT saying Kid
world is no good place for kids..they just have a few things to fix.. As well, Talkcity isnt my server nor do i promise them 'status'...they come free willingly..NO MEMBER WAS PUSHED... they read the website and joined.   As well Paul, My parents wouldnt 
ike this, but there' s no 'club' any more.. i have changed it all :)... and confidental is confidental :) Kidsworld abused my right of that.. and no where did it state in KW's rules about your 'peferences' being a bad influence..nor did any of that HAPPEN
at kidsworld.. i'd like to talk to you paul, let me know

Okay, Paul....What you said was appreciated, as everything everyone puts down. If that is your opinion on this...Great. But, you really would have to be at KW to see...I agree with themrbon completely. He never actually brought that kind of club to KW. I 
m a straight female and I am sure of this. He gave information on the club to a member who wanted it, with the trust that it would remain confidental. Needless to say, it didnt. He never gave the info out on IRC...it was thru ICQ. I am sorry if we dont se
 eye to eye about this. We also are not trying to lure Kids away from KW. Yes, I am a leader with AKW because I know what went on there :o) I am proud to be able to state my views. We are only trying to get our point across. I never started a bi-sexual cl
b for teens online. I am not bi-sexual either. But, I came to this club, and am helping with it because I believe in this. I am not following anyone around. Because, one...I am not a dog. I came in here on my own. So no one can say this was started with t
e fact that a bi-sexual club was brought here.

Hi. My name is Paul. I'm 35 years old and have 2 children that I'm considering to bring onto Kidsworld. After reading the views and opinions of everyone, it doesn't seem like an actually goal is there to be achieved. On one end, we have a former worker, t
at is a teen and is responsible for a Bi-Club Survey circulating Kidsworld.
To my knowledge of the policies of Kidsworld, this survey breaks the rules. I feel the IRCops of Kidsworld acted appropiately within their rights. We must remember that Kidsworld is an independently run network and that the decision that was made, was mad
 on the basis of the policy regulating Kidsworld. As far as the supposed 'logs', it would wrong to attempt to make a comment on them, as logs can be altered. Pasting logs will not prove anything wrong. I respect KidsWorld and its workers/helpers for doing
what they can to make it the safest network for kids. They should be praised for starting such a network, not harrassed or looked down upon. I am very familiar with IRC and how it works and the terms associated with it. It is my opinion that anyone that i
 given the IRCop status, deserves it. And any ban placed upon a user is more than needed for a reason. From continuing to read the postings here, it seems as if Themrbon is just trying to promote his network and draw the kids away from Kidsworld. In almos
 every post from a 'anti-kw' member, I have seen an advertisement for Talkcity. Yet the IRCops and workers that have posted here aren't advertising. They are simply defending the network. I would be more than happy to tour the network and in most probable
cases, let my children join it.
I think the message of saying kids are unable to do things are their own, is misinturpeted. Kids are very well able to do things that they put their minds to. But I ask this, How many 'anti-kw' members actually joined on their own? And not joined because 
hey were promised some 'status' on Themrbon's network. It is in my opinion that adults with kids will treat other kids as they do their own. Which in most cases they are treated as if they are the world to their parents. So, the bans handed out to 'anti-k
' members, are deserved. Kidsworld, as a private network, reserves the right to refuse use of its services to anyone it deems a threat to the network. As any network has this policy. Members of 'anti-kw', you are a threat to the integrity of the network. 
'm more than sure Themrbon would remove anyone from his network that is a threat to it. It is in one's human nature to get rid of problems. As I see it, 'anti-kw' is a problem and I would not want my children exposed to the material that was sent out by T
emrbon. Ask yourself this, How many of you would still be on IRC if your parents knew what you were doing on here? Attempting to promote a bi-club for ones own self gratification is wrong. You, Themrbon, should promote your club on your own network, as it
seems you regulate the rules there.

Tsk Tsk...Ya know..I really despise reading something that upsets me after I have already left an opinion. I am a very opinionated person...Dontcha think? Hmm....Well....To Romeo's dad: With all due respect. I agree with you on most of your thoughts, and 
hey were appreciated. The things I said at the top of this, were not addressed to you :o) Romeo in my opinion, was just stating his beliefs. I agree with him totally. Im sorry, you are his father. I just really hope he tells you the whole story. To the re
t of KW: Yikes people... We havent insulted you..or bashed you at all. Please have the same respect for us. Also, messing with themrbon does nothing to us but help prove our points. Keep on helping us. It is appreciated. hahhahahaha. Anyways...lemme get o

Okay. Here I go again. #1 This site is not JUNK. okay? These are our opinions, and we will share them :o) #2...bashing us and saying we torment is a really good way to express your views *NOT*. It doesnt help any to promote KW or yourself to try to insult
us. But, Hey...what works for you. That was a really immature thing to say....really :oP

To The following people-LuceNT-...your page has nothing to do with the reason why i made this, i've read it and it's ALL wrong... I'm not disgruntle..i'm just unhappy..I'll have the new website up Tommorrow..be ready :)

To Romeo's Dad-Your view is appreciated..But, Kidsworld hasnt told you the all out truth Sir, I was harassed by DiceMan , he was a Kidsworld Worker who came to be for 'sex'. And your son is just a friend of mine and nothing else. The survey was a stupid i
ea and was done by me and some other teens. That club isnt going on now days due to the circumstances it held. Also, your Sons Views on this page were nothing to Downsize Kidswrold. and they banned him for that..sir, i think Romeo made a good point..that'
 all.. If you want more information or would like to talk to me personally, please do :)

-to N/a aka Car54-
Dear Car54,
your views were TOTALLY wrong.. I never got any chance to do anything else..nor would i come back to Kidsworld due to the harassment i recieved from you, lema, and others. I totally heart-full believe my views are right

***THANKS FOR YOUR VIEWS****
WEBSITE WILL BE UP TOMMORROW!

Now if your in the mood to torment a good net (at least SOME ppl know its good) join this club. Now they say kw is bad? pah! I was suspended from my oline for a while because i didnt do my job. Now im on my way to getting it back, just the same as any hel
ers that are suspended/fired can do. They do good enough and impress opers they get it back like that. Themrbon has gone way to far with his junk, he was given 2 or three chanches to improve his act. Now did he? I dont think so! -The Techster of the 'net

To KidsWorld : Gline me :O) I erased the server offa my list anyway. I dont like threats. Make it a promise already will ya? About Romeo. He has views, but they were respectable towards you and KidsWorld. The log of Lema and themrbon disgusted us all. We 
ave any right to acknowledge that. So does he. Romeo, I am sorry about you and Savannah....Really...you two are really great friends of mine. Show her TalkCity :o) Why let the opinions and threats of one server destroy love...even if it is online.Stand up
for yourself! I am proud of you...really. She loves you...then i am sure she will come to TC. I miss seeing her too :o( , and to Bryan : Like I said, actions speak louder than words. My point is not age. My point is there are wrong things going on at Kids
orld, and I am gonna tell about it. Not disrespectfully, or anything. They are grown, so I do respect them. I was taught to respect my elders. But....I only respect them as elders, because they see the wrong, and do absolutely nothing about it. Okies? E-m
il me. :o) I'll tell ya about it. -Im outtie like a bellybutton-

I think that everyone is forgetting the  purpose Kidsworld was created.  It was created so kids could have a safe virtual environment they could communicate in without the worry of being exposed to sexually explicit material, verbiage or "surveys".   I th
nk that we all must remember that when we are in someobody else's "home" (or environment) we must abide by their rules.  If we find that we don't like their rules, we are always welcome to leave and go elsewhere.  I believe that the worker's at kidsworld 
ry their best but they are all human.  I think that they all need a pat one their back, and the acknowledgement that someone does appreciate all they do.  I have 2 younger children than "Romeo" and would have been very upset it they were "surveyed" in the
manner Themrbon was surveying kids.  Yes!  Romeo was banned, once I found out the circumstances of him being banned, he also was grounded from the computer.

To Bryan:
Yes, this page Started out as a 'flame' war only to be started by uncalled for and unjustice reasons.. but it's changing..more facts..more 'calm' attitude...Gline is where you cant go THERE @ all..but, Romeo didnt downsize Kidsworld nor Me...he spoke on b
th sides..as Jeremy did and he gets to stay..but, Romeo cant due to he said he sorta agreed with us.. Now,  if you will read below Car54 is a KW worker and he 'promised' others they wont get glined...Romeo goes to Kidsworld to speak with his girlfriend.. 
Yes, they can be volunteers and they do it cause they want to, but they should do it right..Their actions they have taken are totally 'rude' and uncalled for. I've NEVER said kids cannot do anything because it's a lie.. I'm a teenager and i'm standing up 
or MY rights..so they can too,  We here at AKW just want Kidsworld ro recognize kids are not 'dumb' or niave.. we know our stuff.. And we wont take it.. They just have a few things WE notice that is wrong that they should fix...and if they do it, this pag
 wont stay up...  if you have any further questions feel free to let me know ;) I thank you for your time to come express your views.

Yes i will post again.
To "Romeo", i'm not familiar with the term "G-Line" but i am assuming it is a type of restriction or banning.  After what you said about it being "Lema"'s server and not for kids, of course they would keep you out because you dont want to be there anyway 
ecause of their way of running things.
To "Themrbon" From what I saw of your page, you show no constructive criticism to Kidsworld, only flaming.  That is uncalled for when dealing with volunteers.  They dont *have* to do this, they choose to do it for the good of you.

To "Shroomy": again i say i dont see anywhere where anyone said that "kids cannot do anything" except for in your and "Themrbon"'s posts.

Hey Romeo and Kidsworld, See, Romeo, I knew they would do this, they tell people to 'give your views' but behind our backs they threaten them with a gline..this has been our point all along... it's 'LEMAs' Server for 'LEMA' not for the 'KIDS'.. Romeo isnt
and hasnt joined AKW due to he see's views both ways... Romeo, to you my friend, i'm sorry for them doing this, but i'm glad your standing up for yourself, We will do all we can w/o offending kidsworld, but i'd suggest you e-mail Savannah and get her to s
art coming to Talkcity, i promise you Talkcity wont Gline you for your comments... And as to the Parents..my point has been 'proven' again... BTW-Romeo i need a log of this :) have to have some backup to your story before we do anything else. :) thanks fo
 letting us know

Bryan, I am not sure if you will come check up on this page...but...if you happen to read this : One, your comments were very appreciated, but it is not the fact that they say kids cant do anything. As you know, actions speak louder than words. It seems t
 Me...that they think kids like us cant come up against their organization in a respectful manner. I am not stating they are all wrong, but I think it's time these issues came out, and if my friends and I are the ones to do it, reguardless of our ages, We
will. Thanks again, feel free to e-mail me.

Dear Bryan,
Hi, I'm themrbon, and i'm the AntiKidsworld Leader, hehe :) your comments are VERY appreciated, and i would like to respond to a few. As a Teen, I'm very 'debateful' i like to say my view, and this page is for teens and adults to do so. But, As you have n
t been to Kidsworld, I would say it's a great place FOR a kid to be, but the workers and such ...need to work on a few things.  We've tried to talk to them on THAT basis..but, they are acting like inmature people , and exposing other things. I would tell 
ou that Talkcity is a good place for your child due to we do educational chats and i work there...And the place isnt picky on who comes, but we dont tolerate stuff :)Phoneix or however it's spelled Didnt say nothing about 'us' accomplishing things, but di
 state to me that we couldnt do anything about it. Which in turn, I hate to tell him, Teens CAN make a Difference. I'll be glad to talk with you on a one-to-one basis.. and visit Kidsworld website at http://www.kidsworld.org.. I'm glad you took the time t
 come and give us your views :)

-Peace- Themrbon

I have visited neither kidsworld or this page before.  I was just reading some of the comments on this page and I would like to do my good deed for the day and try to show you the point of view from an innocent bystander.  The long speech by "Phoenix" see
ed to have gotten alot of responses by the ones called "Shroomy" and "themrbon", who i assume runs this page and this anti kids world group.  I believe what the long speech tries to say is that you can hold a view, and not try to make everyone believe it.
 And when "Shroomy" says that someone said that kids cannot accomplish anything, i see that nowhere.  Without looking closely, i believe that you can think that "Phoenix" says that, but he distinctly said that you are supposedly using that as an excuse.  
hats the way i personally take it.

As a parent, i would still check out the Kids World for my child, but i would also keep in mind what the "other side" says.  It seems to me that "themrbon" is a disgruntled worker.  "Shroomy" has some very good points, but they are all on the issue of kid
 not being able to accomplish something, which is not stated directly in any post that I can see.

If you want to help kids, why dont you go out and do it instead of making fun of an organization that is trying to do so?

Good point Shroomy! and Ty, it's sorta the point and not :) i did leave and come back cause they needed the help, but i got glined when i came back, cause they 'think' too many things and dont know the truth :) I do hate it when they take your words and m
ke it something else, but when you talk to them about it, they say you are twisting THEIR words around..hehe :)
We're working on the page all :-) it looks Awesome  it 'should' be out by Friday..but, some of the sections are in the hands of some people, so it will take a bit :)

Feel Free to use this alot :) and keep my #'s rising :) I'm planning on getting w/ Link Exchange :)

Guys, The way you all seem to be putting it, Themrbon was G-LINED due to him quitting.  Does that mean that since I quit I should get a G-Line, I THINK NOT. Sincerely yours, Ty "DaTaDuDe" Shuff

Response to Jeremy:
I'm glad for your views, like i said, this is not a website for  'my views only'...That's why this page is going UNDER construction for two days for revision our goal is still the same.. And for the reason WHY i left kidsworld.. I left WAY before they fou
d out about my life.. I left due to my job @ Talkcity was moving up. Lema,Dort, Crooow, and others know that's the plain and simple truth, i got glined after that..NOw to your point about my supporters, my supporters are my friends..who see the 'reasons' 
 made this page, i'm not holding anyone against their reason for joining this. And i have my rights to my opinons..and so do you. But, When I get a 20 yr old man working @ Kidsworld to come sexually harass me @ my work..and i contact Lema about it and all
i get it's 'my fault' due to i told everyone about me.. or when Car54 harasses me on ICQ with words of 'gay and buttfu*****"...And I contact them and get nothing done..but he's statement is "Off of Kidsworld, I can do what i want, and they cant say nothin
" and i do quote. 
jeremy, yes we havent talked, but i have the 'common sense and maturity' not to go around hacking into people's pages like  Kidsworld did, or harassing them, as they do me.. I tell my side..and stick with it..nor do i post someone's  stats on a Website fo
 'rebuttal'...I hate to tell everyone, that e-mail was "SECRET" and the parties involved agreed and knew about it. 

Now, Jeremy..I'm mature, i'm a young man, a young man stands up for his beliefs and doesnt fall into a pit of 'someone running his life'..as others have done at kidsworld. I choose my life.. that's maturity, now , your views, or great.. and i do appreicat
 them, but Like Kidsworld has said, and i will consider you with kidsworld..Is they wont harass us..so, i hope you dont do more than state your views not in a 'degrating' way..
thanks

To Phoenix-

ok, so you mean, i wont be harassmed by you, car54, LuceNT..or anyone else? Great! I'm still going through with those harassment charges...and you coming to talkcity to harass me during my work is totally uncalled for.. my status @ Talkcity is only a host
. and i know this job is better than working at kidsworld...As to my 'ego'..you got a bigger thinking KIDS cant make a different..you need to grow up... As well, Talkcity is not affilated with this, but i do believe it's the BEST
SAFEST and cares bout it's users...for what THEY want..not like kidsworld, which is just up to you and not the kids..

As to the parents, Kidsworld is not a safe place for you kid.. i know this from being a Cyberangel..Kidsworld disliked Cyberangels due to our Great Help we give..

http://www.cyberangels.org

And Parents, more 'FACT FUL' information is on it's way...

Any further harassment from Kidsworld via THIS GUESTBook, ICQ,e-mail, my website or Where i work, will be held through Cyberangels and others.

Thanks for your views ..Kidsworld!

Its sad how when people do something wrong, the first thing they do is blame others, to make it look like what they did was ok.  They say things like, "...well, I was JUST expressing an opinion..." or something like "...I was JUST standing up for what I b
lieve...".  I'm here to tell you, that noone JUST does anything, and noone JUST believes something, noone JUST does something wrong.  People do, believe, and think the way they do FOR A REASON!  Let me ask you, What are Themrbon's reasons?  Why did Themrb
n REALLY decide to leave Kidsworld?  Oh, you might say to me, "he didn't leave he was fired!".  That's BS!  Yes, he may have been fired, but know the truth, he CHOSE to leave kidsworld.  He KNEW the rules, he CHOSE to break them...he CHOSE to leave kidswo
ld.  

What is he CHOOSING at this very moment?  What choices is Themrbon making right now, even after choosing to leave kidsworld?  How do his choices make you feel?  

To those who support Themrbon:  What will it take for you to see what he is doing here?  Are you going to continue to let one "little boy" to wrap you around his finger?  (Yes, I said "little boy", becuase he's not acting like a young man)  Are you going 
o keep letting him fill your head with CRAP like "..I'm JUST defending myself"?  Are you going to let him take away what you KNOW is right and good, only so he can keep himself from feeling guilty about what he did (and is probally still doing, only you k
ow what that really is)?  Believe me, I know, he is throwing you chains with rocks on the end of them, he would rather not sink alone.  I think deep down, he doesn't want to sink at all, but yet he is still CHOOSING to do just that.

To Themrbon:  Them, I haven't really spent a whole lot of time talking to you, but in the times I did, even after what I've learned here, I think YOU are ok.  But your ACTIONS stink like rotten eggs.  I hope someday soon  you find the courage to be a "you
g man" instead of a "little boy" who likes to take ppl down with you.  You spend a lot of time talking, but you never say anything, isn't it truth that you talk JUST to be heard?  Maybe you JUST use other ppl hoping that they will not leave you all alone.
 Courage doesn't mean JUST letting everyone know who you are... courage is when you do it without using people, without throwing ppl chains with rocks on the end of them...that's something a childish punk does.  Good luck to you, at this rate, you'll need
it.  Your Friend, Jeremy.

Everyone!  I can see what Themrbon's doing here, and what he's all about.  I hope you find the courage to see the truth.  Please don't come to me whining about what I've said here, because life is about choices and I choose not to care what you think.

Peace,
Jeremy

This is the final response from anyone associated with kidsworld.  All else that is posted is heresay.  Kidsworld will now neglect this petty organization and its members.  Any attempt to contact us further will be viewed as harassment, whether it be emai
 or on IRC.  On irc, it will result in a gline.  Via email, it will result in a phone call to your ISP telling them that you are using email to harass.  Furthermore, I believe that this group and its members are being used to do two things.  One, get back
at kidsworld for themrbon's firing (which I reiterate was due to the kids being put in danger.)  Secondly, to get more people to his IRC server (talkcity or whatever) because he has obtained some sort of status, thereby increasing his ego.  Therefore, we 
ill not further participate an any discussion regarding this subject matter.
As for the people whose opinions were posted, you will not have the hassle of connecting to Kidsworld anymore, as will not be able to enter; we are only doing you a favor.  You have your views, now live up to them.  
We *volunteers* at kidsworld have careers and studies to which to attend, yet we still make time to make kidsworld a safer place.  I believe we all are insulted deeply at this page; if you don't like what we strive to make, then do not come here.  However
 it is not necessary to make lies or even justify it; frankly its your decision and we couldn't care less.  We at kidsworld are also glad that parents can see through this scheme and learn the facts themselves, and not, as you say, from a poor, unresponsi
le kid.

To the end of themrbon's ego and its consequences,
phoenix

Okay, KW...lets get this straight NOW! One thing!!! That is disgusting the way you posted personal material of themrbon's to embarass him. You have proved yourself to act like children! I am 13 and I don't act like that!! You had NO right trying to embara
s him!! You are grown adults, if you want to fight OUR movement, do it like a normal decent adult. Come against me all you want. I wrote that last one before I read what you all have written. PLEASE...e-mail me!! I want to hear this from you all!!! I beli
ve that was a disgrace, (everything you've put) to the nice and helpful people at KidsWorld. I was really trying to stay on one side of the line, but you have split me down the middle, and I am taking force with the side that is telling the truth, and is 
ot degrating anyone. Yes! This is through the eyes of a 13 year old girl. I am not that naive as to see this. I really hope you dont take us children as being blind. To Dort, and Croooow, and others : I am really sorry. You all have been my friends on Kid
World, please, help make KidsWorld a better place. You have the power to do it if we dont :o)....hehe BUT WE DO!!!!

To KidsWorld: With no disrespect added.

I was at KidsWorld for a while. I loved it, and I still enjoy it. But! In the past weeks I have seen many things which have throws my trust in the safety of myself and the other kids out the window. Harassment by one of your own to a member of Anti-KW, an
 a very disturbing log. I am not coming down on you for stating your half of this, but you shouldnt come up against a group of children trying to make a decent point. Thanks for the ear.

of a server....  

NEways like I said...  mine and themrbon's opinions differ alot....  I agree with <u>some</u> of what KW does...

First of all.  I think KidsWorld is a farely nice place to chat BUT! I agree with themrbon, I was once a worker.  I was chewed out and SWORE at by one of there now IrcOPS, and if neccessary I'll paste the WHOLE log on here.  They treated ALL the helpers l
ke SLAVES.  You missed getting one age, they made you not only FEEL like crap, but they did it in front of everyone.  Anymore things discoraging Themrbon, I might be half-way tempted to sate WHO I am, and paste the log, so "Kar Kar" watch out <eg> SiNcErL

themrbon, your just so mad at kidsworld firing you, that you made this page, and about bat's last comment, it just shows what peer pressure can do to young kids. and by the way, you have no idea how many users came to me complaining about how you wrere so
hard on them.

Session Close: Sat Nov 15 23:48:14 1997

Session Start: Mon Nov 17 16:30:23 1997
* Logging Lema to: [lema.log]
<Lema> lol
<BatClone> think we're playin', I see
<Lema> do you seriously think I wasted time or even that I would bother hacking your dumb site?
<Lema> too funny
<BatClone> umm..from where you're stooping too, I would think so
<Lema> lol yeah right..kid..you better think.you aren't   being very bright
<BatClone> i'm not, eh? From my viewpoint I am<BatClone> I ee you have nothing to say
<Lema> to these silly accusations? nope. 
<BatClone> they seem silly cuz u think we're scared about what you may do as to "Put on the web the size of our penis'" honestly, I don't care
<Lema> sowhy areyou two making these stories up? ever hear of root logs?
<BatClone> nah, if I was making all this up I wouldn't bother talking to you
<BatClone> I have no please doing it but I wanna know just 1 thing
<Lema> what?
[16:48] [Away Manager: You've been away for 1-[10251M1]- Rec: 0 Page: 01]
<BatClone> why do u work for a net that allows things like animalsex chans and then on kworld somebody does that and they get glined?
<Lema> because we don't help or support those channels...unet is unmonitored..kworld is
<BatClone> But it's allowed. But if you don't like sex channels why do u work for a net that allows it?
<Lema> I'm admin of balt. balt is a hub here..I support my server..not those channels.
<BatClone> do u have any say over them being on here?
<Lema> nope
<Lema> the only thing I can do is to not help them
<BatClon]e> another point I might wanna reach is..why a rebuttle of all things? And I hear things of a lawyer
<Lema> BatClon]e> another point I might wanna reach is..why a rebuttle of all things? And I hear things of a lawyer
<Lema> I'll answer that question here..
<BatClone> note: `phoenix mentioned that..why?
<Lema> rebuttal because kidsworld has done nothing wrong. 
<Lema> you all  are making all kinds of accusations..
<BatClone> nothing but treat helpers like little toys
<Lema> truths are being omitted, twisted and changed
<Lema> andyou weren't glined for being in the club..you were coming to kidsworldlong after that..you know that..you were glined for your stunts the other night
*** Jonathan is on IRC
<Lema> if you were so unhappy..why wasit 2 nights ago you left?
<BatClone> I left KWorld I think 2-3 months ago
<Lema> as far as a lawyer..kw has allways had one
<Lema> no...you didn't
*** Tracker is on IRC
<BatClone> yes, I did, but never said anything
<Lema> I don't see the connection between our lawyer and you
<BatClone> no, phoenix mentioned that to themrbon
<BatClone>  [16:44] <`phoenix> whatever... we'll see what the attorney has to say
<Lema> ok. so what are you asking me?
<BatClone> I'm asking, why ask an attorney for something childish?
<Lema> yes..of course all logs and things were forwarded to our attorney..
<Lema> why wouldn't they be?
<Lema> that doesn't even make sense
<BatClone> because the same reason you would waste your time on hacking our site
*** themrbon is on IRC
<Lema> hehe well bat..you know as well as I how rediculous that is.
<Lema> geocities was already contacted for root logs
<Lema> they'll be with the rebuttal
<BatClone> well, it's no co-inky-dink that when a log is posted with names on it a few minutes later they're gone
<Lema> well..themrbon removed techys earlier at dorts request..so..he must be playing more of his games
<BatClone> no, because I don
<BatClone> don't think he'd do that just for the hell of it
<Lema> I do.
<BatClone> why would he do that?

Themrbon.. whats wrong with what i posted? you seemed to want to spread it around Kidsworld just fine? Besides, what do you have to substantiate your claims? Your word? HAH! That log you have posted was clearly taken out of context, because you have tried
to butcher Kidsworld to a great extent.  You insulted kidsworld with your false claims and then talked to us and proceeded to badmouth us.  We had enough; if you want to fall back on the claim that you are just a kid, do so; it will not get you anywhere. 
You are accountable for your actions no matter what age you are.  Live with it

themrbon, the only reason you want to remove what phoenix posted is because you know it is nothing but the cold, hard truth, behind the hype you have made it into,everything you say about the way kidsworld slaves you is a joke, i would know, im an IRCop, 
nd have been going there for almost a year. ive never seen such lies about the place. yes, we ARENT perfect, but neither are you. have a good day.

Themrbon is in an alternate reality.  I've noticed that most things he blames on Lema (ie. making helpers work like slaves) is actually what he used to do, before he was fired for approaching kids to join a club that featured inappropriate material. To ge
 revenge for this, he passed the blame over to someone else; how mature.  The following log substantiates my claim.  Take a look and see if you or your kids wanted to be subjected to this nonsense.  Kidsworld tries its best to do what it can to protect it
 users; throwing themrbon out was a measure taken to do so.

As Romeo put it, I like KWorld too. But the things Lema said to themrbon were uncalled for. #1 he is NOT conniving! #2....he is a kid. Not an adult to be spoken to like some kind of republican!! He has good points to what he says. I am glad he FINALLY cam
 out to show it!!!

But, I have noticed that some people are really hypocritical! They preach one thing, and do another. What kinda whacked crap is that?!
Some people are ok Like, Dortie, Crooow, and a few others, but BLAH to the rest :o)

Kidsworld is an organization sent up by A person who goes as the nick Lema.  From what I have dealed with here I haven't noticed anything wrong with her actions.  But after reading his logs page.... same addy but logs.html,  I have noticed a few things.  
 have ntices that

1)  Lema has acted as a hypocrit.  She/he says she/he wants to provide a place for kids to be able to chat safrelyy, and she sends someone cussing out themrbon.

2)  She says themrbon is stupid when he only expressed his ideas.... how can you call someone stupid for that.

That is All I want to say right now....
