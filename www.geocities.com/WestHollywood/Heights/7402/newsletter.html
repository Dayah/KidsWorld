<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>After Reading many messages from our WWWBoard and the recent one LuceNT</P>

<P>has provided for Kidsworld users to write on, I have found many questions</P>

<P>unanswered and I will try to answer them all at this time.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>First off, AKW was started for the Kids there at Kidsworld, without anyone</P>

<P>standing up for their rights, It would still be happening. We've gotten</P>

<P>recent reports that SOME changes have happened at Kidsworld. WE are not</P>

<P>like others say, USClub, which is dead and gone, Doesn't involve AKW..
nor</P>

<P>does my Glining, I'm talking of the way I was treated, and MANY others.
We</P>

<P>can all find wrong doings with Kidsworld, I know this. I can ask EVERY</P>

<P>Kidsworld user (all 21 of them) If they can name ONE thing KW could change.</P>

<P>But, I won't, due to if I did, it could cause them being glined from</P>

<P>there. AKW isn't &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;silly&quot;, we started
out like that, but After</P>

<P>many harassments and e-mails, we have re-changed our attitude and we
are</P>

<P>focusing on the problems of Kidsworld. Kidsworld might not read this,
but</P>

<P>heck, who runs AOLsucks.org? We have the right to do this and we will</P>

<P>stick with it. Your not obligated to come on our board and to say &quot;AKW
all</P>

<P>the way&quot;, but we ask you leave nice and simple letters.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Next, Me leaving AKW, I hate to say this and disappoint all you who want</P>

<P>AKW to go down. I haven't Left AKW, or I wouldn't be posting this right</P>

<P>now. I'm Co-President of AKW, AKWJillian is President, AKWTy is Webmaster</P>

<P>and Co-member leader. AKWBat is member leader and AKWViper will be</P>

<P>assigned a position soon. I wont ever Leave AKW due to It's my Dream
to</P>

<P>see Kidsworld KIDS being safe.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Next, Our Website was in high-demand to be put up, Our Content is still</P>

<P>there, just under a different site and the &quot;Under Construction&quot;
is being</P>

<P>constructed. Our Website might not be so great, but we are not focused
on</P>

<P>our site, only of it's content.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Next, LuceNT's recent postings or &quot;old&quot; postings were only
removed if</P>

<P>they were a MONTH old, or they harassed us. I do want to state that LuceNT</P>

<P>makes conclusions on such things and they are not true, he states his</P>

<P>thoughts, which is allowed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>To the Kidsworld users, Yes, this is themrbon, I have started AKW for
many</P>

<P>reasons. I want you to understand you have the RIGHT to post on our web</P>

<P>board. KidsWorld doesn't have the right to tell you &quot;Listen, If
you post</P>

<P>on AKW boards your thoughts, we will gline you&quot;. They might not
have to</P>

<P>said it, but you have it. and if that happens to you, Please, <A HREF=
"mailto:antikidsworld@hotmail.com">E-mail me</A>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Lastely, I want to thank all the parent supporters and members, We're</P>

<P>coming up on our 4th month (in Feb) and we want to see 1 yr! And to</P>

<P>Kidsworld, when your ready to actually listen to us, we'll talk</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>From the writings and thoughts of <A HREF="mailto:antikidsworld@hotmail.com">AKWThem</A>
