Welcome to our AKWClub Web site first off :). Glad you have taken the time
to read up on our club.&nbsp; We are a group of Teens and Kids out on a
'Mission' which is a good one.&nbsp; All of our member at one time have
been at Kidsworld and has had&nbsp; problems with someone there.&nbsp;
We can't tell the people there due to the harassment we have recieved,
so we made this page up. so we can do it.. WWW style.

<P>Our Mission is to help the other kids there that DO have problems but
are forced to go there by parents and are too scared to tell anyone.&nbsp;
We know there is a problem of that there, due to who we have talked with.&nbsp;
We do not seek to have Kidsworld 'taken down' but to refurnish their insides.
That's our mission and we hope to conquer it :)
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Our Main goals are to fix the following problems
<BR>&nbsp;
<OL>
<LI>
The harassment of users to users on the place</LI>

<LI>
The harassment from workers to users</LI>

<LI>
The screening of Adult workers needs to be fixed</LI>

<LI>
The morals of the place, the Educational stand point</LI>
</OL>
There are many, but these are the MAIN facts we believe need to be fixed.
we will have it in detail later on , on this web site.
