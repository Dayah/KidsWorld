<BR><themrbon> Lema..has Dort told you my main purpose?
<BR>[13:53] <Lema> I saw the log..you'll see our rebuttal :)
<BR><themrbon> why do you want to do that? it's going to make things
worse..
<BR><themrbon> my only favor of you all is you clean it up..that's bad
that you jump down one throat and allow the other to stay.
<BR>[13:54] <Lema> kw has a right to defend it'self.
<BR>[13:54] <Lema> you were the one to do it..not the others
<BR><themrbon> correct
<BR><themrbon> you can..
<BR><themrbon> :)
<BR><themrbon> but, all i ask is you treat kids 'with the same respect
you give your workers'.... and you clean up some of the 'crap' that's there..
<BR><themrbon> this isnt a 'kill Kidsworld'
<BR><themrbon> it's a message from many kids that just didnt have the
guts to say it to you.
<BR>[13:56] <Lema> I woe you nothing..nor willI respond to you or your
little interview club
<BR><themrbon> tis fine :) i'll let it be posted that you wont come

<BR>[13:58] <Lema> already is..like being interviewed by  member
of the "antikidsworld club" was an unbiased thing..grow up
<BR><themrbon> Lema..
<BR><themrbon> i wanted people to understand
<BR>[13:58] <Lema> no you listen to me
<BR><themrbon> you should grow up and just treat kids right..
<BR>[13:58] <Lema> YOU screwed up

<BR><themrbon> and THEY
<BR>[13:58] <Lema> YOU did it..NOT kidsworld
<BR><themrbon> dont deserve nothing..
<BR><themrbon> yea..ok..whateva
<BR>[13:59] <Lema> funny how your page changed,and your views once you

<BR><themrbon> it didnt change
<BR><themrbon> but, i had to make it better.
<BR>[13:59] <Lema> yes, it did
<BR><themrbon> my views are the same :)
<BR>[14:00] <Lema> not even close
<BR><themrbon> i just started off with my mind blown
<BR><themrbon> lema..my views are still the same
<BR><themrbon> No kid should go to Kidsworld.
<BR><themrbon> if they treat you like this.
<BR><themrbon> the page STILL states that.
<BR><themrbon> but, i made if more informal to the parents
<BR><themrbon> Grr your ABS bot is flooding me!
<BR>[14:01] <Lema> well..parents can decide for themselves when they
see our rebutal..
<BR><themrbon> hehe..see you want to play childish

<BR><themrbon> that's all :)
<BR>[14:01] <Lema> unfortunately..
<BR>[14:02] <Lema> you are hurting otherkids, and people involved. but
kw will defend itself
<BR><themrbon> hey, that's fine ..
<BR><themrbon> my purpose is for them to know the truth of kidsworld..
<BR>[14:02] <Lema> we will only blank out names of active kw kids
<BR><themrbon> from a kids-point-of-view
<BR><themrbon> Lema..that would be explotation of my rights :)
<BR>[14:05] <Lema> in cyberspace? that you sent to several others?
<BR><themrbon> that you got hold of
<BR><themrbon> by a kidsworld worker
<BR>[14:05] <Lema> you didn't seem to mind them knowing the size of
your penis
<BR><themrbon> hey, it's 'guy' talk!
<BR><themrbon> sheesh
<BR>[14:06] <Lema> or what you wear for underwear
<BR><themrbon> pss..Do a survey :)
<BR><themrbon> you'll see
<BR><themrbon> 'Do you talk to other guys bout your stuff'
<BR>[14:06] <Lema> or that you at that time had had 2 homosexual experiences
<BR>[14:06] <Lema> you made it public
<BR><themrbon> ok...tell me how i did please..
<BR>[14:07] <Lema> how you did what?

<BR><themrbon> and that's just it :)
<BR>[14:13] <Lema> YOU couldn't be bothered to careabout the people
you splashed you rotten morals on
<BR><themrbon> See..

<BR><themrbon> i wouldnt be asking you to not expose KID.
<BR>[14:14] <Lema> you are akid yes.. but YOU caused this..you want
to say things and then fallback on..OH, I'm a kid..so cannot be accountable
<BR><themrbon> no..
<BR><themrbon> listen..please
<BR><themrbon> my main purpose of the AntiKidsworld page
<BR><themrbon> is not to 'kill or downsize' kidsworld
<BR><themrbon> but to let you..
<BR>[14:15] <Lema> was to slander us!
<BR><themrbon> and your ircops know..
<BR><themrbon> that kids are SICK OF IT..
<BR><themrbon> helpers are sick of being your slaves.. you yell @ them..sheesh
<BR><themrbon> and you dont understand they are kids..
<BR><themrbon> K-I-D-S
<BR>[14:16] <Lema>  [#ChaTcIRCuiT] <themrbon> and that's 10
less that go there :)
<BR>[14:16] <Lema> we have miles of logs
<BR><themrbon> As well..Lema,i hate to tell you, and i'm a strong believer
of this.. my ICQ is my ICQ..not yours..not
<BR><themrbon> so do i
<BR>[14:16] <Lema> that willshowyou for what you are
<BR><themrbon> and yes..
<BR><themrbon> that's 10 less that go there
<BR><themrbon> and 10 less
<BR><themrbon> that get abused..
<BR><themrbon> Lema, your logs are the same as mine, my dear
<BR>[14:16] <Lema> I am NOT your dear
<BR><themrbon> I know your not..
<BR><themrbon> ok
<BR><themrbon> hold on..backtrack..ok?
<BR><themrbon> I understand WHY i was glined..in 'one'sense
<BR><themrbon> but i disagree with it..
<BR><themrbon> my opinions are my opinions my citizenship in the united
states
<BR><themrbon> let me express myself.
<BR>[14:17] <Lema> we have month and months of logs. we will expose
you for what you are
<BR><themrbon> if someone believes what i've written
<BR><themrbon> great
<BR><themrbon> if they believe Kidsworld is great
<BR><themrbon> great..
<BR><themrbon> but, this 'childsplay'
<BR><themrbon> that your doing is stupid
<BR><themrbon> all you have to do..is tell me you try to get Kidsworld
to become a better place..and you'll treat the kids with respect..
<BR><themrbon> which IMO your not doing.
<BR>[14:18] <Lema> why? defending ourselves?
<BR><themrbon> no..your doing childsplay.. i'm not trying to do it..
<BR>[14:19] <Lema> again..YOUR opinion..which I thinkis biased and self
wanting
<BR><themrbon> I posted MY thoughts..and showed it to friends..that's
it that's all
<BR>[14:19] <Lema> YOU did it
<BR><themrbon> self wanting
<BR><themrbon> Lema..
<BR><themrbon> did you go read the thoughts of one of your helpers?
<BR><themrbon> and i got more 'statements' from them coming..
<BR><themrbon> :)
<BR><themrbon> let me find it for you
<BR>[14:19] <Lema> now you know you will not be back down to.the great
themrbon
<BR><themrbon> member #102 states-
<BR><themrbon> I dont care for KWorld anymore...I am a helper, and yeah
they try to
<BR><themrbon> treat me like a slave. I hate it :o)
<BR><themrbon> #1..:)
<BR><themrbon> I'm not great..i'm a kid that likes to debate..
<BR><themrbon> and wont back down for my own morals..
<BR><themrbon> if someone has the same morals
<BR><themrbon> great
<BR>[14:21] <Lema> your morals..that introduced bi sexuality to confused
young boys!
<BR><themrbon> you?
<BR><themrbon> young..
<BR><themrbon> sorry..
<BR><themrbon> they are 'my 'age
<BR><themrbon> youngest one was SomeoneDortDoenstwantuphere
<BR><themrbon> and he has his own brains
<BR><themrbon> to fix it
<BR><themrbon> which he did
<BR><themrbon> :)
<BR><themrbon> and i totally respect their decision..
<BR><themrbon> Lema.. i'm not this little 14 yr old who wants to find
people and make them follow me..
<BR><themrbon> but, i am a debater, and i'm supporter for teens.
<BR><themrbon> When i first went to kidsworld
<BR><themrbon> i thought it was great..
<BR><themrbon> i helped you out alot
<BR><themrbon> making it a 'safe' place
<BR><themrbon> i met friends
<BR><themrbon> we became close
<BR><themrbon> i told them about me..
<BR><themrbon> off of your net
<BR>[14:23] <Lema> I used to believe that about you. you'veproven you
are nothing more than an irrisponsible conniving person. and YOU are dragging
kids down
<BR><themrbon> and they were like "wow, someone that's liek me"
<BR><themrbon> I said..ok :) glad i found someone
<BR><themrbon> WE said hey let's start a club..
<BR><themrbon> but we like to know stuff about each other..
<BR><themrbon> so we did that..
<BR><themrbon> yes, they were broad Questions but it's TEENS
<BR><themrbon> then, i asked what's his name
<BR>[14:23] <Lema> and you weren'toff the net when you icq'd those boys
from another net to kidsworld.
<BR><themrbon> i was off your net.
<BR><themrbon> YOUR net..
<BR>[14:24] <Lema> youare trying to twist and manipulate to suit you
<BR><themrbon> and it's their program..
<BR><themrbon> Lema..
<BR><themrbon> let me finish..
<BR><themrbon> please..
<BR><themrbon> i ask what's his face
<BR><themrbon> and he took it hard
<BR><themrbon> i warned him i was going to ask weird questions
<BR><themrbon> only way i knew to find out..
<BR><themrbon> he agree'd
<BR><themrbon> he told you
<BR><themrbon> and then Car54
<BR><themrbon> joined..
<BR><themrbon> i put him on the list
<BR>[14:24] <Lema> oh big deal! they trusted you
<BR><themrbon> and he...
<BR><themrbon> i dont know if you got him to or he did it on his own
<BR><themrbon> Turned around and sent it to you
<BR>[14:25] <Lema> they believed you 1. were a friend 2. were smart
<BR><themrbon> told me 'i'm sorry, i wasnt thinking'
<BR><themrbon> Then..when i make this page
<BR><themrbon> he pages me
<BR><themrbon> and calls me a gay ass fucker cock sucker
<BR><themrbon> and harasses me
<BR><themrbon> follows me on net's..
