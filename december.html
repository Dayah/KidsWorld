    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anti-KidsWorld has threatened to take &#147;legal action&#148; if themrbon's telephone number is posted on the Official KidsWorld Rebuttal. I am not at liberty to say how or through whom, but they do sound very serious. I honestly don't think it will come to legal conflict, and I am not well-versed in online law, so I really am in no place to make a guess at what the final result will be. I guess I'll just sit back and wait for it to unfold. Speaking of the Official KidsWorld Rebuttal, I still don't know when it will be complete. My estimate would be sometime next week.</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seems that I am losing sight of the real issue. What does trying to start legal matters have to with the real goal of Anti-KidsWorld, and for that matter what exactly is the goal of Anti-KidsWorld? When I opened my eyes and blew away the smoke I still saw the same thing as always, a slander campaign to by people who want to take down KidsWorld.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was in Knoxville today doing Christmas shopping and missed whatever happened today. I'm becoming a bit lethargic about updating the news because I have other more important things going on in my life now.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From here on, I'm not going to update the news daily. The news section will be for important news only. In the mean time, stop by the <A HREF="http://disc.server.com/discussion.cgi?id=6679">new Anti-KidsWorld feedback area</A>. I no longer need to expose the moronic and nonsensical ways of Anti-KidsWorld; they do a good job of that themselves.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anti-KidsWorld cleared the web board. I guess I'll have to find a copy somewhere. If anyone has it in his or her browser's cache, please send it to me. Hopefully, they realized the stupidity of their posts decided to bail out while they still could. Since the board is gone, I will try to remember some of the things that were on it. &#147;Techyman your 11.&#148; That's an excerpt from a post by the Anti-KidsWorld &#147;leader.&#148; What is he saying? &#147;I have no argument, so I'll just point out that you are younger than me.&#148; A post by another Anti-KidsWorld member contained the text, &#147;That goes to show how scared Kidsworld is.&#148; He was speaking of the URL for the Official Rebuttal being hidden. They are working on the page and don't want anyone to see it until it is complete. If anything, the fact that they haven't gotten around to finishing their rebuttal shows how little KidsWorld cares about Anti-KidsWorld.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One Anti-KidsWorld leader <A HREF="http://akw.home.ml.org/interview.html">interviewed</A> another a few days ago. I really don't see any point in this. Does one anchor from NBC interview another? I don't think I've ever seen Barbara Walters interview Hue Downs. What is up with that?</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you haven't noticed, Anti-KidsWorld likes to show off e-mails and logs of harassment, well, today I have one to add to their list. While chatting on ICQ with themrbon (exchanging messages), it got a bit &#147;involved.&#148; I did keep a <A HREF="harassment.html">log</A> of what was said, though. Warning, this page contains censored cursing.</FONT></TD></TR>
