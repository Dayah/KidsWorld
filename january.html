    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I see a lot has changed while I was gone. First, themrbon has dropped out of Anti-KidsWorld. That was definitely a smart move, considering the effort is a failure. If I started something that I knew was failing, I would also back out at the first opportunity.</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many idiotic things have been posted on the Anti-KidsWorld web board as usual. Most of it is either outrageous lies or contradictory statements. For example, you will notice not_tellin', a regular poster on the Anti-KidsWorld web board, is constantly harassed by the Anti-KidsWorld members because he does not use his real name. Then, the exact same people turn around and say they understand his reasoning behind not using his real name. Visit the web board and read through for a good laugh.</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The word &#147;degrade&#148; is getting old fast. Overuse of such a word would normally be okay, but for the most part, it's being used incorrectly. The definition of degrade is <I>to lower through mistreatment</I>. The constant use of it by everyone is really getting to me. For this reason, I request that you use a dictionary, rather than further misusing and abusing this word.</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Looks as if the Anti-KidsWorld page is undergoing construction yet again. Can we expect further weakening from Anti-KidsWorld, as we have seen with previous page reconstructions? Only the terrible HTML and vocabulary of whomever is making this page will tell.</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another thing that's been bugging me is the uncreative use titles on the Anti-KidsWorld web board. It becomes near impossible to find a certain article with subject headings like &#147;heh,&#148; &#147;blah,&#148; &#147;lalala,&#148; and &#147;hmm.&#148; In the future, please consider using intuitive subjects, versus uninformative interjections.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was looking through some old logs lately and stumbled upon this one. Apparently, everywhere themrbon and his group go to chat, one of my friends is there. The friend, who shall remain anonymous, sent me this log a few months ago. Note that I have censored the name of the person who supposedly Lema sent to spy on Anti-KidsWorld.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;KidsWorld does not send people to spy on Anti-KidsWorld. Some rogues who claim to represent KidsWorld may have bothered Anti-KidsWorld, but they are in no way associated with KidsWorld. I see no reasoning at all behind any spying, for either party. KidsWorld has nothing to hide and doesn't care about Anti-KidsWorld. I guess themrbon will have to find something else to cover his &#147;booty.&#148;</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;KidsWorld is not putting up a rebuttal page simply because they feel the Anti-KidsWorld movement was a failure. Why give a few kids who do nothing but defame (there's a good synonym for &#147;degrade&#148;) KidsWorld attention?</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I come before you today with more logs to scrutinize. This one is from a post on the Anti-KidsWorld web board. It was posted by themrbon on December 18, right after I made <A HREF="harassment.html">his attack on me through ICQ</A> public. Since then, a little of themrbon's logic has kicked in and temporarily overpowered his accusatory sense. Themrbon's post follows:</FONT></TD></TR>

       <TT>Lucent, you'll never learn not to alter logs, you live in the same time zone as i do, and my logs only show from 12:52 to 12:58, where did 1:06 come in play? may i ask? As well, our personal club business is none of your business, and the so called harassment is called short temper due to your such an annoying person... Our logs will be up soon.</TT>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are six things toward which I would like to draw your attention. First, he accuses me of altering logs for the <B>second</B> time? How odd, I do not recall altering the first log, much less this one. What was the first log anyway? Maybe one of you can refresh my memory. Second, I think it's a shame that themrbon has resorted to an &#147;accuse first, ask questions later&#148; philosophy. Third, he just admitted that his system clock was two minutes off. (Mine is synchronized to the US Naval Observatory.) Fourth, he says his &#147;personal club business is none of your business.&#148; Where does this come in? He just wanted to insert a random, off-topic factoid in the post? Fifth, this &#147;so called harassment?&#148; Yes, my word for this would be harassment, care to share a word from your vocabulary? You're right, I shouldn't reply to you when you message me, I might set off your short temper. Sixth, and finally, where are your own logs? They are probably buried somewhere in that monstrosity of a web page.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Much to my dismay, Anti-KidsWorld has redesigned their web page. The abuse of frames makes me want to hurl. In the top frame, they have &#147;AKW CLUB!&#148; This text stays with you as you <B>try</B> to navigate the pages. Why do we want our view cluttered with this text? Am I going to click Member Info and forget I am viewing the Anti-KidsWorld page? Their main page consists of a sloppy drawing of a house, an Under Construction warning, and a definition of &#147;degrading.&#148; What happened to content? As I tried to navigate through their page, I was shocked at the number of Under Construction warnings. I don’t invite you to my house when it is still being built. Please don’t invite me to your web page when you are doing the same.</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have started my own <A HREF="wwwboard/">Web Board</A> in response to the mass deletion of my messages. I recommend you post on my board so that your messages are not deleted as well. As you may have read, any messages that are not &#147;beneficial to their cause&#148; will be purged.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seems the Anti-KidsWorld webmaster has taken my suggestion and removed the top frame. Sadly, there is still much more to be done before this can be categorized as an acceptable page. As for the content, I don’t know when we’ll be seeing any of that.</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am recovering from the flu and haven’t been online in some time. It doesn’t look like much has happened in way of news while I was gone. A few have posted that they have started a club known as ATC (Anti-Themrlame Club). I have decided to join this club and hope to become a leader, maybe you could join as well.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While chatting on another kids’ IRC network, I noticed themrbon join the channel. On this network, you are required to use your real name, so I do not believe he recognized me at first. He immediately began spreading negative propaganda about KidsWorld. For example, &#147;Ever heard of Kidsworld? / DONT GO THERE!&#148; My motto is, if you’re going to defame another network at least make a little chitchat beforehand. Don’t just join and &#147;let the d*gr*d*ng begin.&#148;</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two things to show you today, both of which are quite embarrassing to themrbon, Anti-KidsWorld coleader. First, I caught the coleader impersonating the AKWMom. AKWMom is Shroomy’s mother, who has decided to become involved in the Anti-KidsWorld &#147;Club.&#148; For your information, Shroomy is the leader of Anti-KidsWorld. Well, themrbon decided to defend himself with a <A HREF="wwwboard/messages/94.html">post to my web board</A>. In this post, he used the name AKWMom and her e-mail address, trying to make it look as if the AKWMom actually did post this in defense of themrbon. I would not have checked my access logs had I not noticed one of themrbon’s idiosyncrasies in the message, the use of &#147;due to&#148; in place of &#147;because.&#148; When I went to check the access logs, there it was, themrbon’s host. I promptly showed him <A HREF="wwwboard/messages/110.html">this information</A>. To save <B>some</B> face, he quickly ran to my web board and posted an apology for his lie.</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next, I’m sorry to say that themrbon or Ty, the AKW webmaster, doesn’t have access to a grammar checker. As a random act of kindness, I have decided to <A HREF="grammar.html">help them with their grammar</A>. This was taken from the Anti-KidsWorld page, newsletter section.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Themrbon has changed psychological tactics in <A HREF="http://disc.server.com/discussion.cgi?id=6679&article=216">his latest post to the AKW web board</A>. He is saying that all of us are wrong, him included, as if to appear mature. VertMan cursed, which themrbon’s morals declare as &#147;wrong.&#148; He then calls me a liar yet again, apparently working on his d*gr*d*ng techniques. He goes on to brag that he has admitted the wrongdoing, impersonating AKWMom. First, he uses VertMan and I as scapegoats to make him look less &#147;wrong.&#148; Then, he glorifies himself above us because he admitted impersonating AKWMom <B>after</B> I expose him as a liar, which certainly falls under my morals as wrong. He also claims to want to &#147;resolve&#148; things. There is nothing here to resolve. For some reason, he and AKW still think that they are going to accomplish something.</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His post also included a blatant attack on my web board, saying it is one-sided. Any and all AKW members are free to post incriminating evidence and powerful arguments on my web board. Do they? Hardly, my web board only appears one-sided because the AKW members have no proof. They can’t even hold up an argument. I welcome all AKW members to make fools of the KidsWorld visitors and me. By the way, I have links to all the AKW pages. I don’t see how someone could only see one side of the argument.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seems as if I have a knack for knowing what the AKW members are going to delete or change. For some reason, themrbon was embarrassed by <A HREF="themrbon.html">his old personal page</A> and decided to change it. I just happened to have kept a copy of the old one. When I posted it, he became somewhat angered and began calling my link &#147;fake.&#148; Well, AKW, here comes another page I kept. This is the <A HREF="oldakw.html">original AKW page</A>. I started my page shortly after this one was put up. Not but a few days later, AKW redesigned their page. This brings the total number of AKW pages to three.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wouldn’t consider this actual news, but I thought I’d make you aware of it through the news section anyway. I have made a <A HREF="quickref.html">quick reference page</A> with short, one-line descriptions of each news article. Even if you aren’t looking for a particular article, read through the synopsis. It’s a good chronology of everything has happened in the past three months. You’ll also find that I have divided the news up by month. Navigation bars are at the bottom of each page.</FONT></TD></TR>
