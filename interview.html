    <TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">LuceNT was G-Lined because he pulled a nutty and nuked a lot of the kids on the net. He knows that's a DoS attack and is not only against the law but [also] against KidsWorld's rules.<BR>Themrbon was G-Lined because he was passing an application around trying to get a lot of the kids at KidsWorld to join a club he started, US Club. Joining a club would have been fine, but asking young boys the size of their penises and what kind of underwear they wear is very unacceptable. Some of the kids joined thinking he was in a position of authority on KidsWorld because he worked for KidsWorld previously but had to quit for a job.</FONT></TD>

    <TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">Scared? Nah, but to expose kids that will twist and manipulate anything you say, isn't worth it. They're just kids. I won't get into a battle with a couple of kids that no matter what you say will manipulate. People are seeing what they are doing.</FONT></TD>

    <TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">No. I have no problems with bisexuality. One of my best friends is gay, and I'm very close to him. It isn't somebody's individual choice that I have a problem with. It's when they try to get others to make the same choices as them.</FONT></TD>

    <TH VALIGN="TOP"><FONT COLOR="#FF0000" FACE="Verdana, Arial">A:</FONT></TH>
    <TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tough question, I really don't pay attention. In the beginning, I did to see if they had any real comments that we could correct, but they never did. I do know that they had asked The_Joker to come here and use their nicks, and that they and Bat have been here more than once, so I guess they have no club cooperation. As far as teamwork, it seems that themrbon is the speaker, but he continually says nothing. The others mimic or say the same things repeatedly.</FONT></TD>
