    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have decided Anti-KidsWorld is not worth my attention. They have accomplished nothing in the past four months. Their group is falling apart. They even admit this. Themrbon is asking members to renew their membership. Why? &#147;This is due to the lack of activity of our members.&#148; Rather than continuing to play games with what's left of the group, themrbon, I think I'll devote my attention to something more worthy, school. This page, of course, will remain up. There may be a news post every once in a while, and I will continue to add and remove from the list of AKW members.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I got an exclusive <A HREF="interview.html">interview with Lema</A>, the founder of KidsWorld. This is the only interview Lema will ever do. You will find the answers to many debated questions, such as why I was G-Lined and an official response to the ever-popular, &#147;Will KW ever acknowledge AKW?&#148; If you read one interview this season, this should be it.</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bat, third in command of AKW, stopped by KW a few days ago. He acted as if nothing happened. After KW verified it was him, he was immediately G-Lined. It doesn't appear that he cares about AKW anymore. When I asked him why he was still in the group, his response was, &#147;I don’t know.&#148; When third in command is this lackadaisical, you know the club is doomed. Well, we knew that all along, but now we’re sure.</FONT></TD></TR>
