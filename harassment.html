  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Note: ThemCCC and I have spoken before on ICQ, but this is the first time it has gotten this &quot;involved.&quot; He always sends the first message. I never initiate conversation with him. Everything is verbatim what was said on ICQ except the full curses said by ThemCCC were censored (letters replaced with stars in braces). I do see that strange error in the chronology, 1:06, 1:05, then 1:06. There is probably a bug in the way incoming and outgoing messages are saved. Yes, I do really say &quot;bleep&quot; when talking. Upon adult request, I will send the uncensored, un-HTML'd text log.
