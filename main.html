    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Recently, a former <A HREF="http://www.kidsworld.org/">KidsWorld</A> worker has started some sort of &quot;revolt&quot; against KidsWorld, a respected IRC network for kids only, which was most likely an act of retribution. He was G-Lined (banned from the network) for attempting to coax the kids and staff of KidsWorld into joining some group for <A HREF="bisexual.html">bisexual</A> teens. Although I believe in equal rights for all sexual preferences, this is <B>not</B> the place to promote the preference of your choice, especially not to young, impressionable kids.</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In response to this, the group leader states, &quot;it wasn't through kidsworld it was through icq.&quot; <A HREF="http://www.icq.com/">ICQ</A>, for those of you who are not familiar with it, is a buddy list. You add people you know and it will notify you when they are online. Although this is true, who were the people that he contacted through ICQ? KidsWorld kids and staff. How did he meet these people? Through KidsWorld.</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before <A HREF="www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/Heights/7402/">Anti-KidsWorld</A>, there was a club known as &quot;US Club.&quot; Since then, this group has dissolved and reformed into Anti-KidsWorld, with basically the same members and leaders. This US Club, a group of mostly bisexuals, took a survey of their members. I have obtained part of the information from this survey. The purpose of posting this information is to show you what this group does. Members of the US Club have verified that they participated in this survey and answered the questions herein. You will also find the US Club application and newsletter below. Someone from US Club, who is currently in Anti-KidsWorld, has threatened to &quot;hack&quot; any site that posts this information and remove it. All I can say to that is, &quot;Good luck, because you'll need it!&quot;</FONT></TD></TR>

    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The group leader fits the profile of a disgruntled worker perfectly. He is angry because he was G-Lined for something that violated the rules and code of ethics of KidsWorld after reaching such a high rank. Before the incident, he was a good helper who tried his best. It is simply that his anger crowded his better judgment. In speaking with him you may notice how he tries to cloud the issue with other, non-relevant topics such as KidsWorld policies and rules.</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was also G-Lined for some amount of time <B>and</B> fired from KidsWorld but for something completely unrelated to this incident that happened quite a while ago. They had good reason to remove me from the staff. I still go there often, but not as a worker. KidsWorld is a respected place for kids, and I made a mistake. If anything, this shows the control and high standards of KidsWorld. Not just anyone can work there. I have personal experience with every member of the staff. They are all hard working and dedicated. To the best of my knowledge, the accusations made by themrbon and his group are false, and I have never encountered anything of this kind at KidsWorld. Note that I have been a regular on KidsWorld at least three months longer than themrbon.</FONT></TD></TR>
    <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For whatever reason, he wants others to join his &quot;revolt,&quot; and is peer-pressuring many of them into becoming members. Think twice before you join this group. First, why are you joining someone in a revolt against a kids' network? Second, have you examined both sides of the argument, or are you just joining because one of your friends joined?</FONT></TD></TR>
