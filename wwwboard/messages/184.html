:   That page has been changed, I contacted WBS and they changed it for me.  Second off, LuceNT try the "real" link, not an old one.  That's old as..well.USclub..actually older and holds no evidence to you except your posting bisexual's pages.<p><br>Bleep yea it's been changed. That's why I saved a copy before you could change it. I know when you are going to run off and change or delete thinks, so I save local copies of them for when you do delete or change them. This happened to be one of them. Yes people, this really was his page, but when he saw that I found it he changed it. Now, he's on some kind of mission to show people his new page and spread the word that mine is fake. Is he that ashamed of an old page of his? I'm still not clear on his lie about this page. First, he says he didn't really make it, an enemy did. Then, he says he really did change it. Then, it's a fake link posted by me. I don't know which lie <B>not</B> to believe.<p>Oh, and by he way, I have other pages I have saved that have since been deleted. I'll post them when I'm board.
