: why does it allways amaze me when I see themrlames excuses? How when somebody says something to him, they d*gr*t*d akw.. when he says the same thing to them, he was defending himself or it was ok for him because he was mad. He thinks it's ok for him to go to other nets and tell people not to go to kidsworld, but claims on his application for akw that he isn't trying to "downsize" kidsworld. Then he has a fit and posts vertmans private mail all in the name of "he downsized akw". Does this lamer make sense to anybody but himself? themrlame, are you retarded? you make NO sense! shroomy, bat, data, garabaldi, does he make sense to you? HAHAHAHAHA this is amazing that those 4 even are his followers! I'd like this a topic at our next ATC meeting.. *is themrLAME retarded?"<p>RETARDED!!
