: : : First, I am not a movement or a club or a cult. I simply made a web page defending KidsWorld from the false accusations and slander of a club. Please do not continue to refer to me as the Pro-KW movement. I don't want members, just read my page and post whatever you would like to my web board. I know how much AKW would like to think they are up against a club or a movement, but they're not. I'm just one person who made a web page.<br>: : : Next, I respect the anonymity of a person. If you would like to say something anonymously on my web board, please do, KidsWorld <B>or</B> Anti-KidsWorld. I'm not going to check who every single person is who doesn't use a real name. Something I do not respect is the right of a person to impersonate another person. If you impersonate someone, you'd better do a damn good job of it. If not, I will check and make sure you are who you say you are. The only person I have checked is AKWMom's post that included the words "due to" in place of "because." This is a themrbon trademark, and I knew something was up. I have never checked the identity of anyone else, and don't plan on doing as such. You're secret is safe with me, as long as you indicate you are making yourself anonymous, e.g. "not_tellin'," or "Secret," rather than, "AKWMom."<p>: : so, your sayin<br>: : you want find out "whos' acting in part of me by using themrbon and posting fake messages?<br>: : Is this what it is?, Just wondering<p>: I just checked the server logs and it is three different people. All of which the identity is unbeknownst to me. Two from different branches of ibm.net and one from mindspring.net. I did not address this issue before because it was obvious which ones were fake.
