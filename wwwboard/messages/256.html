: I come to this board, usually a few times a day to check up on messages, who doesn't? I see the word "lame" used many times, and cheap insults towards AKW, and themrbon. I have noticed there aren't many towards me, which is good. Would you like to know why? Here...i'll let you in on a secret....**I play by the rules!!** An ex AKW member, and a boy by the name of Chaos/K-OS went to KW, using my name. He is a close friend from home, who I told about AKW/KW. He also is at Ibm.net. I admit, I wasn't too mad about the idea, but I wasn't exactly thrilled either. I came to AKW, on my own. I stayed on my OWN. I became a leader, ON my OWN. I become *the* leader, On my own! Haven't you noticed a patern? I am trying to show you all my side of this story, but all you want to do is insult themrbon. Come on, stop being so close-minded already. Would you like to know why I was g;lined? For stating my opinion on the AKW discussion board. I simply said some people who were there, were hypocritical! I wasn't a member, and still was g;lined. Now...send in some replies..and, challege yourselves...find a more mature word than "lame"<p>Yea, I do notice a pattern. A pattern of you bragging about everything you've accomplished in AKW. Have you accomplished anything in real life? You aren't <B>really</B> the leader. I think you're missing something. Themrbon made you the leader so he wouldn't look as bad when you had to admit your failure. What? You're thinking you climbed the ranks of AKW? No one promotes someone above himself without a really good reason. Okay, since you're so mature, Mrs. Shroomy, could you explain to the rest of AKW that you aren't going to make a difference and that this is just something so themrbon can drag his friends down with him?
