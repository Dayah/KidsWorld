: : : : Here we go again all, themrLAME trying to cloud the issues. Who cares about the MOTD or the specific rules? Even and once or sense should tell him not to ask young boys the size of their penis or what kind of underwear they wear. Now themrLAME wants to see a rule #4-NO asking young boys the size of their penis. This is typical themrlame lameness. He wants to cloud the issue to try to cover himself. What a LAMER!<p>: : : all I can say is your wrong, you think you know me, I'm clouding NO issue here.<p>: : LOL themrlame at his best. NO themrlame, asking young kids the size of their penis is not right. If you need to have that spelled out for you on some paper or MOTD then you are ven LAMER than LAME!<p>: NAWWWW..its' wrong? NO wonder I said I KNOW it's wrong.. CANT you all READ?  I'm just saying the RULES can be a little more "organized" than going off what happens.  IT would solve about 1/2 of those 100-300 GLINES they have<br>so why even bring it up to try to prove your point lamer??? Will you please try to stop being so lame? YOU are the one that brought this up in your defense, AGAIN you were proven what a lamer you are! So again you change your story! If you weren't such a sad lamer you'd be funny!<br>
