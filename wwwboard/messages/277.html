: I have to disagree with what some of she said.  I have NO knowledge of Bat going to Kidsworld, and he's not really in-command due to lack of willingness.  AKW is *not* Doomed.  there you all go, reading our minds! hehe.<p>I'm sorry there's a lack of communication in your club. Maybe you should talk to him every once in a while.<p>:   First off, Lema, WE came you, I came to you and was ready to talk...way back when you "said"  I twisted your words. I did not do a such thing, It's called trying to prove a point.  But now, I *really* dont care about Kidsworld.  You haven't seem to grow much, for Your little kids who still talk to me give me weekly reports of a 22-30 user level status.  I know you recongize us, and We're here anytime you just want to talk.  I'm really glad you read LuceNT's board, ofcourse you wouldn't READ what someone had to say against you, just live with people on our on your side.  WE *will* allow the Internet world to know of your place, and I dont understand your thinking we twist things.<p>Don't try to talk <B>to</B> Lema. She doesn't care what's posted here. She doesn't even read it. Of course he knows she recognizes him because he's in her brain. I don't think Lema particularly likes people inside her brain. Please vacate the premisis.<p>: **AKW IS NOT THE ONE WHO TWISTS WHAT YOU SAY***<p>Yes, the capital letters and stars enclosing your comment will make people listen to you. I guess it's all you can do considering you have no argument, just capitalize.<p>: ****Start Insults, Lame words, and acts of "trying" to prove me wrong here**<p>How incredibly idiotic. You have said nothing. I've listened to you babble about nothing for months now, and frankly, it's starting to get on my nerves. Why don't you try saying something? At least when people do this, my English teacher puts, "Nice BS." on the paper. But you don't really deserve that, because it's not even nice BS.<p>***Use my tactics to say nothing here***
