<br>: Well, I have a few things to say. First, I think that this is all silly. Dealing with the original problem, the US club, Why don't they just go on EFnet or Dalnet? More people there. When they were g-lined, why did they have to pull a lot of other people into it? There were some good people that we lost cause of this. Also, Lots of people have been g-lined. I don't see a big whopty-doo by them! And, Their leader is a QUITTER! That is the only way to say it. He starts this, and then quits! Well, That's all I have to say for now :)<p>Forcey!  You tell him!  :)
