: : : : : Lema,<p>: : : : : If you check this board....<p>: : : : : I have my own thoughts and opinions. In the interview, you stated you tried to talk to themrbon in the beginning. Why haven't you tried to talk to me? I don't care if all of the AKW blame is placed on me. I care about everyone's opinions, but I simply ignore the messages trying to insult me. I can talk to an adult rashionally. If you don't believe me, because I am "just a kid," ask Dort. Before I was g;lined for stating my opinion, he and I held a conversation about AKW, and in the long run, he told me he honestly couldn't answer one of my questions, and was I sure I am 13 (to that...yes, I am 13). Point of this terribly boring messgae is, I would like to talk to you, or whomever. It doesn't matter to me. I don't want a letter of apology saying you all will never swear at a child again, you are a grown woman, and an elder of mine. I have to respect you, but if you are so grown, I should be able to trust your word that you wouldn't swear at children. Umm..e-mail me or something<p>: : : : : Jillian<p>: : : : hey shroomlamer, you want to talk to Lema about swearing at kids? Your showing us how they swear at kids by showing us car54 saying hell twice? You need a grip on reality! Your mouth is as bad as themrlames, and you have no right to complain about somebody swearing at you when you swear at them. You people are sad! truly. You all are getting what you give. DEAL with it you bunch of LAMERS! If you treat somebody one way, expect it back. When you get it back, be grown up enough to deal with it. I asked Lema if she'll talk to you just to see what her reaction would be. The answer is no, and I don't blame her. You may be older than me shroomlame, and you can yell "grow up" all you want. YOU need to grow up! I'll NEVER respect an elder like you! You've sworn so many times on kidsworld, you big lamer!<br>oh that's bright themrlame, attack somebody simply for being younger than you. that needed to be said. what a lamer you are!<br>: : : alrighty, I'll play you all's game<p>: : : #1-  Car54 said more than "hell" twice, read your logs, <p>: : : #2-  I've never see Shroomy cuss....<p>: : : #3- PROVE IT<p>: : : #4-  If we're now on the subject of language, CHECK YOU Alls.<p>: : : we've never called you all "lame" or "Lamers" or "catlame" or anything  so, til you can prove we did it to you... your wrong there<p>: : ok you lamer, calling your bluff, if I waste my time digging up some of your pottymouth, of your lies and print them, can you do the same? what will my payoff be for 10? 20? PUT UP OR SHUT UP YOU LAMER!<p>: man?!?! 5th Grade Education!<p>
