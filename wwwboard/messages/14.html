<br>: : : Ok, ok so you AKW people hate us huh?  Well don't hate me cause I'm just doin my job in keepin this net safe.  I think this AKW vs. KW is kinda dumb because what excatly are the "AKW" going to do?  I'm sure they aren't going to come storming on KW and try to attack everyone but then again everyone has a right to speak their oppion as I am now.  So "AKW" and do what they want but I for one am...KW ALL THE WAY BABY!!!  :)<p>: : : PS.  I really don't know all the ordel about this matter so fill me in a bit<p>: : Altough I'm not required to talk here, I want to say one thing<p>: : AKW ALL THE WAY BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<p>: Dear Friend,<p>:   AKW was started due to the "wrong" acts that Kidsworld has taken to some of our friends, and the things that happened on there.  Your working there is cool, We're not saying LEAVE KIDSWORLD.. but AKW has had affect on KW, they might not admit it, but , it has, WE know this.  AKW is only here to help Kids who go to Kidsworld understand that THEY dont have to hide what they see is wrong.  Lema has already (taken action) towards Romeo a while back for posting on a WebBoard his thoughts, and it's wrong.  So, you see, LuceNT starts this, SO Kidsworld workers can post here.  But your not to post on our AKW board....no never :/  see? a little "we're touching them"?  Well, visit OUR board at http://www.akw.home.ml.org/feedback.html and if you need any further assistatnce e-mail me thanks<p>Um..maybe you should set a password for your site because if you don't want people like me at your board then you don't have anything stopping us.  Also, I thought you were not going to post here anymore?  Wha happan?  Anyhow I'll be on here checkin out what your AKW members have to say because I find it kinda amusing.  I still think your little group is pointless because you ARE NOT going to prove a thing like I said before.  Your idea of "wrong" acts is dumb.  And I don't know how your AKW has "affected" KW because it hasn't.  And I'm sorry if I touched your little percius board.  But there isn't a law against it.  Well to conclude this message I must say that you have stooped to a low point in your life and well..your a L-O-S-E-R.  <p>This is my oppion towards this AKW ordeal and that's all.  Sue me if what I do is wrong but in the constition it says I have a freedom of speech.  Thank you.
