: :   I never said Kidsworld didnt know what bisexuality was, I just cant believe they dont accept it.  I did it the wrong way, but even IF I had told lema before hand she would have glined me. <p>: You seem to be either missing the point or clouding the issue. KidsWorld does not frown on bisexuality. Be bisexual on your own time at your own privacy. KidsWorld frowns on people who try to coax their members into joining a group for bisexuals. They would frown on someone who tried to get kids to join a group for straight people just as much. Don't try to make it look like your "freedom of preference" is being imposed upon, AGAIN. This argument has already been shot down, drop it.<br>: Ahh, in the last sentence you will notice the keyworld "if." 'Nuff said.<p><br>No, If I were to tell Lema.. (in which she said "you could tell me anything") I would be glined.  They would gline anyone who wasn't in her "Acts of goodness" you could be a Lesbian and most likely you'll get glined.<p> and they kept talking of rules... I NEVER saw any rules.  Except the helper rules, woohoo!.  If you know a link for KW rules or know the text..please, let me see it.<p><br>
