Hey everyone,<p>How's it going?  Very nice here...I am reading this rather one-sided board, and I am kinda disgusted. This crap with my relationship with themrbon is corney. #1- the reason we broke up, is none of any of you all's business. #2- It certainly wasn't for a guy. If it were, he would have heard it from me...badly. :o)<br>Also, we don't (uh oh..that lame word) degrade anyone on AKW. If VertMan chose to leave AKW, good for him, no hard feelings...because frankly, I don't care either way. Many of you talk of this non-existing "bisexual" club. I hope you have lots of fun blaming us on that. I am not bisexual, I was born straight, and I intend to stay that way. Sorry to bust your bubble. I am happy I have taken on the AKWleader position. If any of you have a problem with that, e-mail me. As far as us "harassing" Vertman, that is so beyond fake. I don't like him, so why bother with him. He msged ME on ICQ and swore all of this crap, and then complains to me, something about Juliet (one of my friends) from KidsWorld. I don't know what everyone's major malfunction is, but I suggest you all grow up. I will probably get many boring replies, bring them on.
