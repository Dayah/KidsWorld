First, AKW has had no effect on KidsWorld. You that haven't been there in the past however many months do NOT know this. I, who have many connections there and see the number of people connected every day can see that KidsWorld was not affected one bit by this club, and never will be. Second, no this is not so KidsWorld workers could post, it's so ANYONE can post and not have their messages deleted because they are not directly benefitial to AKW. You may have noticed the latest 10 messages are all from AKW members on the AKW web board. Why doesn't AKW just take down the web board and start a newsletter, rather than act as if they want anything but positive feedback.
