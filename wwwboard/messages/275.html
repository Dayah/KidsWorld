I have to disagree with what some of she said.  I have NO knowledge of Bat going to Kidsworld, and he's not really in-command due to lack of willingness.  AKW is *not* Doomed.  there you all go, reading our minds! hehe.<p>  First off, Lema, WE came you, I came to you and was ready to talk...way back when you "said"  I twisted your words. I did not do a such thing, It's called trying to prove a point.  But now, I *really* dont care about Kidsworld.  You haven't seem to grow much, for Your little kids who still talk to me give me weekly reports of a 22-30 user level status.  I know you recongize us, and We're here anytime you just want to talk.  I'm really glad you read LuceNT's board, ofcourse you wouldn't READ what someone had to say against you, just live with people on our on your side.  WE *will* allow the Internet world to know of your place, and I dont understand your thinking we twist things.<p><br>**AKW IS NOT THE ONE WHO TWISTS WHAT YOU SAY***<p><br>****Start Insults, Lame words, and acts of "trying" to prove me wrong here**
