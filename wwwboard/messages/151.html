: : and you are?<p>: Didn't say I wasn't.<p>: : tell me how you think *your* always right?  or Vertman at that? I called him what he called me.  It's an opinion and I dont *misuse* degrading. *You* started the word, and not_tellin lead it on.<p>: When you degrade people, and I point it out, I am right. He calls you a name, you call it back, you are both wrong. VertMan doesn't sit behind a lame web page and say he doesn't degrade. He says what he thinks. You, however, claim not to degrade but do constantly.<br>: I did not start the word d*gr*d*. I just remember seeing "degrate" on your page, in your messages, in e-mails to me and decided to correct you on that (check my news archive, November). Your favorite word is still d*gr*d*, which I rarely use, except to point out when you contradict yourself. As for not_tellin', he's fairly new to all this, I don't see where you get off saying WE started using this word OR we use it more often than you, those are both incorrect.<p>: : We posted that on our site. so the "Definition" of it is clear. since, people like to use it.<p>: Yet you still d*gr*d* VertMan.
