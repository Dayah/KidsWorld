: : :   You show me your degree in mind reading and I'll believe you all can predict and know just what I and others think.  There's many times when you all post things that are so wrong , because you make WRONG assumptions. You all don't know me or Shroomy and you have no right to assume what we're talking about,  you take it upon yourselves to say "I know what your doing", no you don't, you can make your opinion but use the language, and don't try to "read" my mind..  There's only one of me, not 12 <p>: : you all are so lame! LuceNT, be honored, they allways copy whatever you say. LOL you told them they were reading Lemas mind, now they try to use that on us. They can't even think for themselves!<p>: Well, in the beginning at least they tried to think for themselves. After having shot down every shabby arguing and slander technique they can come up with, they have decided to copy my techinques. This would have been a good idea had they cited specific examples of "mind reading." I think we can look forward to my other methods being copied as well. Watch closely!<p>You want "proof"..here's proof..READ YOUR WEBBOARd... I'll find the specific ones I'm looking for when I have time, (heading to school right now)<br>
