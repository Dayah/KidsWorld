: : Lema,<br>: : If you check this board....<p>: Since the interview says she does not check the board, the entire paragraph below is invalid. I will reply to it anyway.<p>: : I have my own thoughts and opinions. In the interview, you stated you tried to talk to themrbon in the beginning. Why haven't you tried to talk to me? I don't care if all of the AKW blame is placed on me. I care about everyone's opinions, but I simply ignore the messages trying to insult me. I can talk to an adult rashionally. If you don't believe me, because I am "just a kid," ask Dort. Before I was g;lined for stating my opinion, he and I held a conversation about AKW, and in the long run, he told me he honestly couldn't answer one of my questions, and was I sure I am 13 (to that...yes, I am 13). Point of this terribly boring messgae is, I would like to talk to you, or whomever. It doesn't matter to me. I don't want a letter of apology saying you all will never swear at a child again, you are a grown woman, and an elder of mine. I have to respect you, but if you are so grown, I should be able to trust your word that you wouldn't swear at children. Umm..e-mail me or something<p>: Lema will not talk to. You must have lost it. You can't join a club and then try to do things individually. First, when you joined AKW, all the blame and stereotypes were put on you. Second, you're thinking of yourself while you're the leader of this club. Why should she talk to you? You lead a slander campaign against her network. Your club doesn't want anything but to lower the number of users, now that they know negotiation attempts have failed. "E-mail me or something?" Didn't you read the interview? Go look at that last question. KidsWorld will <B>never, ever</B> acknowledge AKW or any of its members.<p>Sup? This is flappie AKW SUCKS.
