: First off,<p>:   That page has been changed, I contacted WBS and they changed it for me.  Second off, LuceNT try the "real" link, not an old one.  That's old as..well.USclub..actually older and holds no evidence to you except your posting bisexual's pages.<p>: <br>: In which,<p>: I'm not "bi" anymore<p>You are so LAME themrlame! You said a couple of posts below that you never made that page, now here you say you contacted WBS and had it changed! Again, you don't even lie well! You lie so badly, you trip all over your lies! We know that page is right, and we know you made it. Another thing you LAMER, you claim kw all along doesn't understand bisexuality, again you show your lameness, saying to all of the bisexual and homosexual people out there that you can just decide to turn it off and on! What a LAMER!
