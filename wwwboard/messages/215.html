: : : : : : You seem to be either missing the point or clouding the issue. KidsWorld does not frown on bisexuality. Be bisexual on your own time at your own privacy. KidsWorld frowns on people who try to coax their members into joining a group for bisexuals. They would frown on someone who tried to get kids to join a group for straight people just as much. Don't try to make it look like your "freedom of preference" is being imposed upon, AGAIN. This argument has already been shot down, drop it.<br>: : : : : : Ahh, in the last sentence you will notice the keyworld "if." 'Nuff said.<p>: : : : : No, If I were to tell Lema.. (in which she said "you could tell me anything") I would be glined.  They would gline anyone who wasn't in her "Acts of goodness" you could be a Lesbian and most likely you'll get glined.<p>: : : : You know, I would let you insult VertMan like this, because he can defend himself, but Lema does not care about your slander campaign. I'm not going to sit here and listen to you put thoughts in her mind. You must have access to her brain or something, because that's the only way you could know something like that. Except, of course, you saw her do something like this, which she has never done. Keep telling yourself you were banned for being bisexual, maybe you'll eventually believe it.<p>: : : : :  and they kept talking of rules... I NEVER saw any rules.  Except the helper rules, woohoo!.  If you know a link for KW rules or know the text..please, let me see it.<p>: : : : KidsWorld MotD. If you weren't g-lined from KidsWorld, you could connect to any of their servers and view all the rules.
