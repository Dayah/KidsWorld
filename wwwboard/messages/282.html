: Lema,<p>: If you check this board....<p>: I have my own thoughts and opinions. In the interview, you stated you tried to talk to themrbon in the beginning. Why haven't you tried to talk to me? I don't care if all of the AKW blame is placed on me. I care about everyone's opinions, but I simply ignore the messages trying to insult me. I can talk to an adult rashionally. If you don't believe me, because I am "just a kid," ask Dort. Before I was g;lined for stating my opinion, he and I held a conversation about AKW, and in the long run, he told me he honestly couldn't answer one of my questions, and was I sure I am 13 (to that...yes, I am 13). Point of this terribly boring messgae is, I would like to talk to you, or whomever. It doesn't matter to me. I don't want a letter of apology saying you all will never swear at a child again, you are a grown woman, and an elder of mine. I have to respect you, but if you are so grown, I should be able to trust your word that you wouldn't swear at children. Umm..e-mail me or something<p>: Jillian<p>potty mout shroomlame! car54 said hell twice. We've all heard YOUR potty mouth, maybe you should appologize to all of us who have had to hear YOUR pottymouth! Lema has never sweared at any of us so stop making up lies!
