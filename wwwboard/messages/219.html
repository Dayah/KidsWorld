Something I do not respect is the right of a person to impersonate another person. If you impersonate someone, you'd better do a damn good job of it. If not, I will check and make sure you are who you say you are. The only person I have checked is AKWMom's post that included the words "due to" in place of "because." This is a themrbon trademark, and I knew something was up. I have never checked the identity of anyone else, and don't plan on doing as such.
