: : Lema,<p>: : If you check this board....<p>: : I have my own thoughts and opinions. In the interview, you stated you tried to talk to themrbon in the beginning. Why haven't you tried to talk to me? I don't care if all of the AKW blame is placed on me. I care about everyone's opinions, but I simply ignore the messages trying to insult me. I can talk to an adult rashionally. If you don't believe me, because I am "just a kid," ask Dort. Before I was g;lined for stating my opinion, he and I held a conversation about AKW, and in the long run, he told me he honestly couldn't answer one of my questions, and was I sure I am 13 (to that...yes, I am 13). Point of this terribly boring messgae is, I would like to talk to you, or whomever. It doesn't matter to me. I don't want a letter of apology saying you all will never swear at a child again, you are a grown woman, and an elder of mine. I have to respect you, but if you are so grown, I should be able to trust your word that you wouldn't swear at children. Umm..e-mail me or something<p>: : Jillian<p>: potty mout shroomlame! car54 said hell twice.
