I hope you have lots of fun blaming us on that. I am not bisexual, I was born straight, and I intend to stay that way. Sorry to bust your bubble. I am happy I have taken on the AKWleader position. If any of you have a problem with that, e-mail me. As far as us "harassing" Vertman, that is so beyond fake. I don't like him, so why bother with him.
