The only wrongdoing he admits is to vertman. It wont work themrLAME! NOT until you admit to all of them. Your lies, twisting of everything, trying to fake email and logs, calling people names. YOU admit to it all you LAMER! YOU were the one that started all of this. Because you had your feelings hurt and were glined. You've twisted everything to suit your needs for revenge, and then you go and post your bi-page linked here! OK, I wasn't serious before, but this is very serious! This is ALL your fault. You used your friends on akw and led them into this to suit your needs for revenge! YOU want maturity? ADMIT it you LAMER!
