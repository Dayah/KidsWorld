: : You need to sit down and read all of these pages and webboards carefully. You need to *read* what you see and you will see nothing but fabrications by AKW. Look at all of the information. These PROKW children are doing a great job at defending what they feel is right. Several of us moms and dads have stayed out of this AKWmom, but you can bet if you start on these kids, we will also get involved. We have allowed your daughter and her boyfriend to make up their side and done it poorly, we haven't interfered. Now I will. Several of us have a lot we will show you if need be, but this is for the kids. I suggest you take a real hard look at all of the information. These kids have a lot of very well constructed points. They continuously show everybody their side and they deserve that right. All of us really don't want to be involved in this, this is for the kids, but that does not give you the right to interfere and think that we wont. We allowed your children to have their say without interference, we would appreciate you allowing our children the same courtesy.<p>: <br>: Your kids can, whoever you are, but their harassment isn't needed. We haven't harassed *one* person on this webbboard, but if you go look around. There's 120,000 Themrlame's, lame and Well, to speak for vertman, my mom would wash his mouth out.<p>:   We have not failed to do nothing, these kids have not made but one point, they don't know the full story.  They only know "Kidsworld's side".  But that's alright.  We're not worried with that.<br>:   <br>:    AKWMom has done nothing of such to stop your kids from writing here..she's making a point.. like you are.<p>So..themrbon, tell me..what is YOUR side of the story?  And..you haven't made a single point either.
