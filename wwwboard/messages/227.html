KidsWorld does not frown on bisexuality. Be bisexual on your own time at your own privacy. KidsWorld frowns on people who try to coax their members into joining a group for bisexuals.

Even half an ounce of sense should tell you that you don't ask young boys, 10, 11, and 12 years old, even other ages, to join a bisexual club and to ask them the size of their penis or what kind of underwear they wear! Stop trying to cloud the issue with specific rules! NOWHERE on earth will you find an MOTD that says rule #4-NO asking young boys the size of their penis! YOU ARE SO LAME! This is just more clouding techniques of yours!<p>
