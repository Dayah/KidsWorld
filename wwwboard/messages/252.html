Okay, people. I understand you have a little heat on themrbon, his decisions in the past were foolish, and in KidsWorld's "rules" (which I believe the IRCops do not abide by) he broke one. I'd like to see what you all can dig up on me! I never insulted anyone, did anything to anyone, swore at anyone....etc...I have played by the rules, since day one, and I will continue to. If you can only fall back on themrbon's mistakes, you are just as bad.
